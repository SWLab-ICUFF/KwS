Wake up! Wake up! [R2D2 beeps] We're doomed. Bartender: No blasters! No blasters! Governor Tarkin: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away forever.@General Tagge: But that's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?@Governor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. Luke: Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.@Biggs: It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Luke: So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?@Han Solo: That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.@Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.@Luke: [angry] Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?@C-3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Luke: I have a very bad feeling about this. C-3PO: Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault! [R2-D2 makes a series of beeps that sound like chuckling] Obi-Wan: [to R2-D2] Hello there. [R2 beeps] Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. [R2 beeps a question] Oh don't worry, he'll be alright. Obi-Wan: The Force will be with you, always.

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.

Wake up! Wake up! [R2D2 beeps] We're doomed. Bartender: No blasters! No blasters! Governor Tarkin: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away forever.@General Tagge: But that's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?@Governor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. Luke: Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.@Biggs: It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Luke: So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?@Han Solo: That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.@Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.@Luke: [angry] Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?@C-3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Luke: I have a very bad feeling about this. C-3PO: Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault! [R2-D2 makes a series of beeps that sound like chuckling] Obi-Wan: [to R2-D2] Hello there. [R2 beeps] Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. [R2 beeps a question] Oh don't worry, he'll be alright. Obi-Wan: The Force will be with you, always.

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.

Wake up! Wake up! [R2D2 beeps] We're doomed. Bartender: No blasters! No blasters! Governor Tarkin: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away forever.@General Tagge: But that's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?@Governor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. Luke: Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.@Biggs: It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Luke: So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?@Han Solo: That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.@Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.@Luke: [angry] Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?@C-3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Luke: I have a very bad feeling about this. C-3PO: Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault! [R2-D2 makes a series of beeps that sound like chuckling] Obi-Wan: [to R2-D2] Hello there. [R2 beeps] Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. [R2 beeps a question] Oh don't worry, he'll be alright. Obi-Wan: The Force will be with you, always.

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.

I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away forever.@General Tagge: But that's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?@Governor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. Luke: Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.@Biggs: It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Luke: So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?@Han Solo: That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.@Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.@Luke: [angry] Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'.

Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher. These are a Tupperware style.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.

Wake up! Wake up! [R2D2 beeps] We're doomed. Bartender: No blasters! No blasters! Governor Tarkin: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away forever.@General Tagge: But that's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?@Governor Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. Luke: Hey Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.@Biggs: It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. Obi-Wan: Use the Force, Luke. Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Luke: So. You got your reward and you're just leaving, then?@Han Solo: That's right, yeah. Got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use you.@Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around. You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you, you're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station is not my idea of courage. It's more like, suicide.@Luke: [angry] Okay. Take care of yourself Han. I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?@C-3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Luke: I have a very bad feeling about this. C-3PO: Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault! [R2-D2 makes a series of beeps that sound like chuckling] Obi-Wan: [to R2-D2] Hello there. [R2 beeps] Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. [R2 beeps a question] Oh don't worry, he'll be alright. Obi-Wan: The Force will be with you, always.

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.

I guess that's what you're best at isn't it?@Han Solo: [as Luke walks away] Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. [to Chewbacca] What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?@C-3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir, please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission. Han Solo: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. [nobody is listening] Don't everyone thank me at once. Title card/crawl: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...@Title card/crawl: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... Princess Leia: Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. C-3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. Darth Vader: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Luke: No, my father didn't fight in the Clone Wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.@Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals; he felt he should've stayed here and not gotten involved.@Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?@Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.@Luke: I wish I'd known him.@Obi-Wan: He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you've become quite a good pilot yourself. [sorrowfully] And he was a good friend. Princess Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Han Solo: This is *not* gonna work.@Luke: Why didn't you say so before?@Han Solo: I *did* say so before. C-3PO: Is there anything I can do?@Luke: Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock. Darth Vader: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. C-3PO: R2D2 where are you? Princess Leia: For luck. Han Solo: I don't what we're gonna do now. Even if I could take off, I could never get past the tractor beam.@Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.@Han Solo: Damn fool, I knew you were going to say that.@Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him? C-3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. C-3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2. Princess Leia: [as the ships approach] Here they come.@Luke: They're coming in too fast! Darth Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.@Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Princess Leia: [to Han] I knew there was more to you than money! Darth Vader: I have you now! Commander #1: We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?@Governor Tarkin: Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Han Solo: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.@Princess Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. [Pushing past Chewbacca] Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?@Han Solo: No reward is worth this. Han Solo: Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Han Solo: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're lookin' for passage to the Alderaan system?@Obi-Wan: Yes indeed, if it's a fast ship.@Han Solo: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?@Obi-Wan: Should I have?@Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers mind you, I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you old man. What's the cargo?@Obi-Wan: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.@Han Solo: [chuckles] What is it? Some kind of local trouble?@Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. C-3PO: We're doomed. Han Solo: [muttering] Boring conversation, anyway. LUKE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANY! Han Solo: Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Princess Leia: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.@Governor Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it, signing the order to terminate your life.@Princess Leia: I'm surprised that you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.@Governor Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution, I'd like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.@Princess Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.@Governor Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the capabilities of this station. Princess Leia: It's not over yet.@Han Solo: It is for *me*, sister. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. *I'm* in it for the money.@Princess Leia: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Luke: [calling after her] I care. [to Han] So, what do you think of her, Han?@Han Solo: I'm tryin' not to, kid.@Luke: [sotto voce] Good.@Han Solo: [baiting him] Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, whaddya think? You think a princess and a guy like me...@Luke: [quickly] No. Princess Leia: He certainly has courage...@Luke: Yeah, but what good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! [Luke and Leia run off in the opposite direction] Luke: I don't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.@Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. C-3PO: We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Greedo: [pointing a blaster at Han] [Huttese] Going somewhere, Solo?@Han Solo: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. [taking a seat] Tell Jabba that I've got his money.@Greedo: Its too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.@Han Solo: Yeah, but this time, I've got the money.@Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.@Han Solo: I don't have it WITH me. [he slowly draws out his blaster while they talk] Tell Jabba...@Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.@Han Solo: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I have a choice.@Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.@Han Solo: Over my dead body.@Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.@Han Solo: Yes, I bet you have. [Han shoots Greedo. Everyone in the Cantina stares at Han and the now dead Greedo who's lying on the table. He gets up] Sorry about the mess. [he says to the Bartender as he leaves] Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Han Solo: What kept you?@Princess Leia: We outran some old friends. Princess Leia: No! Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't possibly...@Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time: *Where* is the rebel base?@Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.@Governor Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation; you may fire when ready.@Princess Leia: WHAT?@Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration - but don't worry; we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Han Solo: It's worse. Princess Leia: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.@Luke: I care. Luke: Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.@Han Solo: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide.@Luke: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?@Han Solo: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doin'. Aunt Beru: Where are you going?@Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere... I'm gonna finish cleaning those 'droids.@Aunt Beru: [after Luke leaves] Owen, he can't stay here forever, most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.@Uncle Owen: Well, I'll make it up to him next year, I promise.@Aunt Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.@Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of. Stormtrooper Officer: Someone *was* in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.@Stormtrooper: [holding up a ring of metal] Look, sir: Droids. Darth Vader: I sense something; a presence I've not felt since... Luke: [about Princess Leia] They're gonna execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?@Han Solo: Marching into a detention area is not what I had in mind.@Luke: But they're gonna kill her!@Han Solo: Better her than me! Darth Vader: And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base... Stormtrooper: Let me see your identification.@Obi-Wan: [with a small wave of his hand] You don't need to see his identification.@Stormtrooper: We don't need to see his identification.@Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.@Stormtrooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.@Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.@Stormtrooper: You can go about your business.@Obi-Wan: Move along.@Stormtrooper: Move along... move along. Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Darth Vader: He is here.@Governor Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?@Darth Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.@Governor Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.@Darth Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.@Governor Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. [answering a comm signal] Yes?@Voice over comm: We have an emergency alert in detention block AA-23.@Governor Tarkin: The Princess? Put all sections on alert.@Darth Vader: Obi-wan *is* here. The Force is with him.@Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Princess Leia: I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay? Gold Two: Gold Five: Gold Five to Red leader, lost Tiree, lost Dutch.@Red Leader: I copy, Gold Leader.@Gold Five: It came from... behind! [crashes] General Dodonna: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed around a direct, large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.@Gold Leader: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?@General Dodonna: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. But the approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set off a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.@Wedge Antilles (Red 2): That's impossible! Even for a computer.@Luke: It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home, they're not much bigger than two meters.@General Dodonna: Then man your ships. And may the Force be with you. Princess Leia: They let us go. It was the only reason for the ease of our escape.@Han Solo: Easy? You call that easy?@Princess Leia: They're tracking us.@Han Solo: Not this ship, sister.@Princess Leia: [sighs] At least the information in R2 is still intact.@Han Solo: What's so important? What's he carrying?@Princess Leia: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found. It's not over yet. Imperial Officer: We count 30 Rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small they're avoiding our turbo lasers!@Darth Vader: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke: I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.@Princess Leia: You're who? Officer Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.@Governor Tarkin: [referring to Leia] She lied. She lied to us!@Darth Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.@Governor Tarkin: Terminate her... immediately! Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them. Luke: She's rich.@Han Solo: [interested] Rich?@Luke: Rich, powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...@Han Solo: What?@Luke: Well, more wealth than you can imagine!@Han Solo: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit. Princess Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Stormtrooper: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Red Six: I got a problem here. My converter's running wild.@Biggs: Eject!@Red Six: I can hold it. Gimme more room to run.@Biggs: You're too low. Pull up!@Red Six: No, I'm all right... [Porkins' fighter explodes from a turbolaser crossfire] Luke: Got 'im! I got 'im!@Han Solo: Great, kid. Don't get cocky. Uncle Owen: Luke! Take these two over to the garage will ya? I want 'em cleaned up before dinner@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on. Get to it. Han Solo: [after Leia blasts a vent] What the hell are you doing?@Princess Leia: Well somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage, fly-boy! C-3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.@C-3PO: You watch your language! Han Solo: Stay sharp. There's two more coming in. They're gonna try and cut us off.@Luke: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast!@Han Solo: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home! We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.@Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...?@Han Solo: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star, or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it.@Luke: [notices a flashing light]... What's that flashing?@Han Solo: [slaps Luke's hand away] We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm going to make the jump to light speed. Han Solo: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Han Solo: Can't get out that way.@Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastic] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your Highness. General Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped, they're more dangerous than you realize.@Admiral Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station. Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since... oh, before you were born. C-3PO: Master Luke, sir. Pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?@Luke: Lock the door.@Han Solo: And hope they don't have blasters.@C-3PO: That isn't very reassuring. Han Solo: Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Luke: I'm not such a bad pilot myself. Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire. Princess Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...@Darth Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.@Princess Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...@Darth Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Luke: [the red R2 unit blows its top] Uncle Owen!@Uncle Owen: [looks up from paying the Jawa] Yeah?@Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator, look!@Uncle Owen: [to Jawa] Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Han Solo: Where did you dig up that old fossil?@Luke: Ben is a great man.@Han Solo: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.@Han Solo: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Luke: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.@Han Solo: Bring 'em on, I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. C-3PO: [to R2-D2] This is all your fault. C-3PO: Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity! Han Solo: Great shot, kid, that was one in a million! C-3PO: Where could they be? C-3PO: Listen to them, they're dying R2! Curse my metal body, I wasn't fast enough, it's all my fault! My poor Master.@Luke: 3PO, we're all right! We're all right! Ha ha! Hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 3263827! Luke: [griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Governor Tarkin: Are they away?@Darth Vader: They've just made the jump into hyperspace.@Governor Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Uncle Owen: Have you seen Luke this morning?@Aunt Beru: He said that he had some things to do before he started, so he left early.@Uncle Owen: Did he take those two new droids with him?@Aunt Beru: I think so.@Uncle Owen: Well, he'd better have those units in the South Ridge repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay. Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.@Luke: What is it?@Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times... before the Empire. Chewbacca: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!@C-3PO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.@Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.@C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.@Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.@Chewbacca: Grrf.@C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. C-3PO: That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault. Princess Leia: This is some rescue! You came in here, but didn't you have a plan for getting out?@Han Solo: [indicating Luke] He's the brains, sweetheart! Imperial Officer: Han Solo: Look out he's loose!@Luke: He'll tear us all apart!@Han Solo: I'll get 'im! [they shoot out the security cameras and kill the officers] Darth Vader: Darth Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you find those plans! And bring me all passengers, I want them ALIVE! C-3PO: [translating for R2] He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. [a diagram of the power terminal appears on the screen] The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Luke: How did my father die?@Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Darth Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.@Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth. Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.@Princess Leia: That doesn't sound too hard. Princess Leia: General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to convey my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Obi-Wan: [to Luke] You must learn the ways of the Force, if you're to come with me to Alderaan.@Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan, I've gotta get *home*, it's late, I'm in for it as it is!@Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.@Luke: Look, I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now... It's all such a long way from here.@Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking. Obi-Wan: There was nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.@Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope. C-3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time. Luke: [to C3PO] Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go. Princess Leia: Looks like you've managed to cut off our only escape route.@Han Solo: [sarcastically] Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, your highness. General Willard: You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.@Princess Leia: We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R-2 unit to help plan the attack- it's our only hope. Stormtrooper: Do you know what's going on?@Other stormtrooper: Maybe it's another drill. General Tagge: What of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical reading of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, they might find a weakness and exploit it.@Darth Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.@Admiral Motti: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe! I suggest we use it!@Darth Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.@Admiral Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient Jedi religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you enough clairvoyance to find the rebels' hidden fortress...@Darth Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.@Governor Tarkin: Enough of this! Vader, release him!@Darth Vader: As you wish. Darth Vader: The Force is strong with this one. Governor Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.@Darth Vader: What do you mean?@Governor Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan. Uncle Owen: [about C-3PO and R5-D4] Luke! Take these two over to the garage will you, I want them cleaned up before dinner.@Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!@Uncle Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Han Solo: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. Greedo: Han Solo: Sorry about the mess. Wedge Antilles (Red 2): Look at the *size* of that thing!@Red Leader: Cut the chatter, Red 2. Accelerate to attack speed. Darth Vader: Han Solo: You're all clear, kid, now let's *blow* this thing and go home! [Luke fires, the torpedoes dive down the exhaust port; the Millenium Falcon leads the remaining rebel ships away as the Death Star explodes] Imperial Officer: Where are you taking this... thing? C-3PO: I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you near-sighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it. Han Solo: One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner. Governor Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.@Darth Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone. C-3PO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.@Luke: He'll be all right. Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?@Han Solo: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Luke: [on first seeing the Millenium Falcon] What a piece of junk!@Han Solo: She'll make point five past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. Obi-Wan: [after hiding from the stormtroopers on the Millennium Falcon] Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?

Sequels were not considered until after it became wildly successful. The name of this movie was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' in 1981 to fit in better with the names of the other films. The later print was the first one to be released on mass market video (an earlier Betamax release did not have the subtitle), and all video, laserdisc or DVD releases have featured the subtitles. The theatrical cut DVDs, released in September 2006, were the first time that the original opening crawl, without subtitle, has been released on home video. The reason 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created the title card 'Episode IV' in the first film was as a homage to 1940's Saturday afternoon 'cliffhanger' serials, like the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. He also used the 'text crawl' the same way each of those series opened up new chapters. He did not at the time have Episodes I, II, and III already planned. In fact, at one point, 20th Century Fox wanted the 'Episode IV' title removed so as not to confuse moviegoers. There are some prints of the film that do not have that title card. A small pair of metal dice can be seen hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon as Chewbacca makes preparations to depart from Mos Eisley. Set designer 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv) claims he added the pair of dice hanging in the Millennium Falcon cockpit (briefly seen when Chewbacca bumps his head on them as he first enters) because there were dice hanging in 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv)'s car in _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). However, Ford's character had a skull hanging from his rear-view mirror. 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) had the fluffy dice. They don't appear in subsequent scenes, because they were stolen from the set and not replaced. On the first day of filming in the deserts of Tunisia, the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years. At 121 minutes (special edition runs 125 minutes) this is the shortest of the six 'Star Wars' films. 'Mel Blanc' (qv) auditioned for the voice of C-3PO. Interested in creating a modest line of colorful space toys, Kenner Toys signed on for the merchandising shortly before _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) opened, although they did not believe the movie would be a hit. When _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) became a hit, they were unprepared to handle the demand and produce enough _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) toys to handle the demand for Christmas. Instead, they sold boxed vouchers for various toys. The toys sold in the 'Empty Box' campaign during December were not delivered until the following March. Prior to the film's release, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop. The only dissenter was 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) who predicted the film would make millions of dollars This is the only Star Wars film where Darth Vader's signature theme 'The Imperial March' is not played in some form or another - as it had not been written at the time. According to 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv), studio executives were unhappy that Chewbacca has no clothes and attempted to have the costume redesigned with shorts. The final scene in which Luke and Han received their awards required a much larger soundstage than was available at Elstree Studios. The scene was shot at Pinewood Studios instead. The shootout between Han Solo and Greedo inside the Cantina was the subject for a lot of controversy and debate among Star Wars fans as to who shot first. Many fans debated that Greedo actually shot first a split second before Solo did, but with careful examination of the scene, it was obvious that Greedo never fired his shot at all. For the 1997 Special Edition release of this movie, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had edited the scene to include Greedo shooting first at Solo at point blank range, with Solo moving his head slightly to the right to dodge the shot before firing back at Greedo. The shooting scene was edited for a third time for the 2004 DVD release, so that both Greedo and Han Solo fired their guns more or less at the same time. 20th Century Fox was so sure _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was going to be a disaster that they came within a matter of days of selling off their stake in the film as a tax shelter. Positive feedback from an advanced screening made them change their minds, and the profits from the film ended up saving the studio from bankruptcy. R2D2 is commonly referred to by movie-goers as 'little Arthur' (Arturito) in Mexico, since the robot's name closely resembles the sound of this Spanish name and is easier to pronounce for a Spanish-speaking person. The original name of the main character in this film was Luke Starkiller, and that was the character's name when filming began in Tunisia. Later, when filming moved to Elstree Studios in London, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had second thoughts and changed the name to Skywalker. This did not cause a problem, as Luke's last name had not been used in the scenes already shot. Darth Vader was the first character that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) created for the story. The origin of R2-D2 can be found in the 'drones' Huey, Dewey, and Louie from the film _Silent Running (1972)_ (qv). Upon meeting 'Douglas Trumbull' (qv), director and special effects chief on 'Silent Running', 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) commented on how much he liked the designs of Trumbull's two-footed robots in the film (which were operated by bilateral amputees). Four years later, a functionally similar design appeared as R2-D2 in 'Star Wars'. Universal Studios, the distributor of 'Silent Running' noted the similarity between the robots (and the similarity of 'Star Wars' to the _Buck Rogers (1939)_ (qv) serials of the '30s), and promptly sued 20th Century Fox for infringement. The lawsuit was eventually settled when Fox counter-sued over _'Battlestar Galactica' (1978) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv), which bore a striking resemblance to 'Star Wars'. This is the only 'Star Wars' movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Two of the creature characters have names which resemble the Russian words for the animals that they resemble. Chewbacca sounds like sobaka (dog) and Jabba sounds like zhaba (toad). 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) asked costume designer 'John Mollo' (qv) to create simple, nondescript costumes without any buttons. The only exception to this last rule were some of the green rebel uniforms worn by extras during the Throne room sequence, as Mollo had to find a lot of spare uniforms at the last minute. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and 'Peter Cushing' (qv) have both appeared in productions of Hamlet. One of Guinness's first roles, at the age of 19, was playing Osric in 'John Gielgud' (qv)'s production in 1933, which is considered to be one of the best theatrical productions of the twentieth century. Cushing played the same part in 'Laurence Olivier' (qv)'s film version of _Hamlet (1948)_ (qv), which marked his first collaboration with future Star Wars cast member 'Christopher Lee (I)' (qv). The name Wookiee came about as a result of an accident. When San Francisco DJ 'Terry McGovern' (qv) was doing voice-over work on _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv)for 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), he made a blunder and exclaimed, 'I think I ran over a wookiee back there.' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), confused, asked what he meant by the term. 'Terry McGovern' (qv) admitted that he didn't know and added that he simply made it up. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) never forgot the cute word and used it years later in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). The targeting grid used for the Millennium Falcon's canon is based on a paperweight 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) saw on 'Arthur C. Clarke' (qv)'s desk. 'Terri Nunn' (qv) of the band Berlin was in the running for the role of Princess Leia and had readings with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv). At one point in the scripting process, the Force was a large crystal or galactic holy grail called the 'Kyber crystal'. Pop Musician Meco recorded a Disco version of the theme song, which also mixed in other pieces of the musical score, most notably the Cantina Band song. The single reached Number One for two weeks on the Billboard Pop Chart in October, 1977. The skeleton that Threepio passes belongs to a Tatooine creature called a Greater Krayt Dragon. This artificial skeleton was left in the Tunisian desert after filming and still lies there. During filming of _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)_ (qv), the site was visited by the crew and the skeleton was still there. The Chewbacca suit retained a bad smell for the duration of filming after the trash-compactor scene. R2-D2's vocal patterns largely contain sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv)'s own voice. In trying to create the beeping, whistling noises of the droid, Burtt found that he was vocalizing a lot of what he was trying to achieve, so he recorded his voice - mainly making baby noises - and then fed it through a synthesizer. Within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. For the special edition version, in the Cantina the close-up shot of the wolfman was removed. He was replaced with a close-up shot of a CGI dinosaur-type man. However in additional frames, you can still see the wolfman in the background. When the blasters are cocked they have a clicking/clunking sound. This is a recording of a parking meter handle being turned. Meco's Disco version of the theme song is the biggest selling instrumental single of all time. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) said in an interview with 'Leonard Maltin' (qv) that the Ewoks in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) were originally supposed to be Wookiees. However since he doubted he'd get to make the third film in the series he decided to make a wookiee Han's co-pilot (Chewbacca.) The following characters 'have a bad feeling about this': Obi Wan (Episode I), Anakin (Episode II), Obi Wan (Episode III), Luke (Episode IV), Han (Episode IV), Leia (Episode V), C3-PO (Episode VI). See also _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv), _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) and _Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)_ (qv). The line is also spoken by Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)_ (qv). Following principal photography, new scenes had to be filmed for the Cantina scene, to give it more diversity and add more aliens to the scene. However, the reshoot set was very small. If you look at the close-up scenes of most of the aliens when Luke and company enter, you can see the same window in the background. The piece of equipment used to fire the Death Star's weapon is actually a Grass Valley Group 1600-7K television production switcher. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and the production team apparently had a series of running battles with the studio cleaning service, which would continually clean and buff the floors on set, even though Lucas had requested that they leave them scuffed and dull - part of his idea that the world the characters inhabit should look 'lived in'. After the sets were constructed, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) went through them and had every single one of them 'dirtied up'. The R2-D2s were all rolled in the dirt, nicked with a saw, and kicked around a bit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) popularized the concept of giving sets/props/etc. a 'dirtied up' appearance, to create the illusion that they were old and worn. However, he was not the first person to use this strategy. Over a decade prior, 'Gerry Anderson (I)' (qv) had extensively used this process in his Supermarionation series, most notably _'Thunderbirds' (1965)_ (qv). The name Luke derives from the Greek word for light, which fits into the film's allegorical themes of light and darkness. The Biblical Apostle Luke was an early convert to Christianity, much like Luke Skywalker converting to the ways of a Jedi. In addition, the name Luke is also a derivative of the name Lucas. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had ILM watch archival footage of World War II dogfights as reference material for the final battle over the Death Star. This method would evolve into pre-visualization 'animatics' in common use today. (Former fighter pilots were also employed as technical advisors, and audio recordings of radio communications made during dogfights were studied, to help with the dialogue.) Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to appear in the film, dropped in optically on top of stand-in actor 'Declan Mulholland' (qv). However, the effect was not acceptable and the scene was cut until CGI allowed it to be completed for the 1997 'Special Edition'. DIRTRADE('George Lucas (I)' (qv)):[1138]: in honor of his earlier movie _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). The film was initially budgeted at $8 million but production problems forced the studio to contribute an additional $3 million. 'Michael Elphick (I)' (qv) was offered a major featured role but could not accept. Some unused footage shot for the film was used in _The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) (TV)_ (qv). 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) deliberately didn't learn his lines for the intercom conversation in the cell block, so it would sound spontaneous. 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) worked as an orderly in a Yorkshire hospital prior to being cast in the movie. He won his role ten seconds after meeting 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the first time; all the 7'2' Mayhew had to do was stand up. When Ben Kenobi is turning off the tractor beam, the set 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was on was only six feet above the ground. Most of the Stormtroopers are left-handed. That is because of how the weapons are constructed. Their weapons are based on a real weapon, where the magazine is on left side of the weapons. This construction caused it to hit the troopers in the chest. Therefore they have to switch grip of the weapon, which made them look left-handed. During the scene on the Death Star right after Ben leaves to shut down the tractor beam, Chewbacca barks something to Luke to which Han says 'Boy, you said it Chewie'. Backstage footage reveals that what Chewie says is 'The old man's gone mad'. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) and 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) are of Swedish and Jewish ancestry, respectively. In the prequels, their parents would be played by 'Hayden Christensen' (qv) and 'Natalie Portman' (qv), who also have Swedish and Jewish ancestry. The first feature film to be screened in Dolby Stereo. Previously, films like _The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)_ (qv) and _Mr. Billion (1977)_ (qv) had made use of the sound system with disastrous results. However, technical minded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) knew exactly how he wanted to incorporate the system and made it work for his picture. Normally 20th Century-Fox released about 20 films per year, but the long-running success of _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) resulted in the studio issuing only seven new films in the entire year of 1978. The first film to make over $300,000,000. 'David Prowse' (qv)'s Darth Vader mask had to be padded with foam because it was much too large to fit over his face properly. The actors found 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either 'faster' or 'more intense'. At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those three words written on it. While filming, a fierce sandstorm destroyed several of the Tatooine sets in the desert outside Tozeur, Tunisia, and filming resumed two days later. The same thing would happen to 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) 22 years later while filming _Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)_ (qv) In earlier drafts, including the ones that were used for audition readings, the planet Alderaan was known as Organa Major. Although the name was changed, the 'Organa' was retained and became Leia's adoptive family name. All of the dialogue by 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv) (Aunt Beru) was dubbed. The day before he began filming as C-3PO, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) tried on his costume for the first time. Within two steps, the left leg shattered down into the plastic of the left foot, beginning to stab the actor every time he took a step. The original editor for the film was 'John Jympson' (qv). 'Richard Chew (I)' (qv) was Lucas' first choice of the editor but budgetary reasons will not allow him to do so. After the first assembly, which was absolutely disastrous, Lucas fired Jympson, asked his then wife Marcia (while editing) New York, New York who in turn brought in Chew and 'Paul Hirsch (I)' (qv) to finish. Mules were used as the main basis for the sound that the Tuskan Raiders make. Prior to the release of this movie, the greatest profit 20th Century Fox had every made in one year was $37,000,000. In 1977, because of the film, their year-end profit was $79,000,000. 'P.J. Soles' (qv), 'Sissy Spacek' (qv) and 'Nancy Allen (II)' (qv), 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), 'Glenn Close' (qv), 'Barbara Hershey' (qv), 'Bernadette Peters' (qv), 'Bonnie Bedelia' (qv), 'Dianne Wiest' (qv), 'Margot Kidder' (qv), 'Jessica Lange (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv), 'Christine Lahti (I)' (qv) 'Jane Seymour (I)' (qv), 'Anjelica Huston' (qv), 'Catherine Hicks (I)' (qv), 'Christine Baranski' (qv), 'Kay Lenz' (qv), 'Kim Basinger' (qv), 'Kathleen Turner (I)' (qv), 'Debra Winger' (qv), and 'Geena Davis' (qv) all auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. 'Linda Blair (I)' (qv), 'Pamela Sue Martin' (qv) and 'Jill Clayburgh' (qv) were considered. 'Alec Guinness' (qv) always recalled the experience of making the movie as a bad one, and consistently claimed that it was his idea to have his character killed in the first film, so he 'wouldn't have to carry on saying these rubbish lines'. Reportedly because he hated working on _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) so much, 'Alec Guinness' (qv) claims that Obi-Wan's death was his idea as a means to limit his involvement in the film. Guinness also claimed to throw away all _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related fan mail without even opening it. Contrary to this, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) has said he made the decision to kill off Kenobi, that Guinness was 'less than happy' his character was dying earlier than expected, and that Guinness appeared to enjoy his time on set. While 'Alec Guinness' (qv) made no secret that he disliked the dialogue in 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script, he claimed that he accepted the role for two reasons: 1). He was an admirer of Lucas' previous film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and 2). The narrative compelled him to read the whole script through to the end, in spite of not liking the dialogue and not being a fan of science fiction. Luke went through several changes. Lucas toyed with the idea of changing him into a woman after cutting Princess Leia from the script. He also entertained the notion of casting the principal characters as a dwarfs. In an early screenplay, Skywalker was a 60 year-old general. In the shooting script, he was called Luke Starkiller but this was changed to Luke Skywalker during production. 20th Century Fox promoted the film at the San Diego Comic Con, believing the attendees of that event to be the film's main target demographic. The pulsating engine sound of the Star Destroyer is a manipulated recording of a broken air conditioner. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned to score the film with existing classical music like 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' (qv) had done on _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv) before 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) introduced him to composer 'John Williams (I)' (qv). Lucas and Williams agreed on a classical 19th-century Romantic music style with liberal use of leitmotif for the score. Since the movie would show worlds never seen before, the music had to serve as an 'emotional anchor' for the audience to relate. In 1998, the film was ranked #15 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. In 2007, it moved up two place to be ranked #13 for the 10th anniversary edition of the list. Cardboard cutouts were used for some of the background starfighters in the Rebel hangar bay and most of the crowd watching the heroes receive their medallions in the final scene. Due to the limited budget the American cast members and crew (including 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)) all decided to fly coach class to England, rather than first class. When 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s mother 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) heard about this she called Lucas, complaining about how insulting it was for her daughter to be flying coach. Fisher was in the room with Lucas when he took the call, and after a few minutes asked if she could talk to her mother. When Lucas handed her the phone she simply said, 'Mother, I want to fly coach, will you f**k off?!' and hung up. 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv) has said that often when the cast and crew broke for lunch, they would forget he was in the R2-D2 outfit leave him behind. The word 'Jedi' is derived from the Japanese words 'Jidai Geki' which translate as 'period adventure drama.' A period adventure drama is a Japanese TV soap opera program set in the samurai days. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) mentioned in an interview that he saw a 'Jidai Geki' program on TV while in Japan a year or so before the movie was made and liked the word. The bantha seen being mounted by tusken raiders after they spot Luke Skywalker's speeder, was actually an Asian elephant dressed in a costume of fur and fake horns. Filming the scene proved difficult, because the elephant was not accustomed to the extreme heat of Death Valley, and kept removing the costume. Several scenes were filmed of Luke with his friends on Tatooine in an effort to introduce the main character earlier in the film. First Luke and watches Princess Leia's ship battle with the Imperial cruiser through his Macrobinoculars and later he meets his best friend Biggs Darklighter in Anchorhead, who has left the Imperial Academy and plans to join the Rebel Alliance, Also present in the Anchorhead scenes were 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Fixer's girlfriend Cammie. All these scenes were later cut, leaving Luke's mention of Biggs to his aunt and uncle as the sole reference to his character early on. The scenes have never officially appeared in any release of the movie, but stills were included in 'The Story of Star Wars' (a book-and-record set), and the scenes also appeared in the comic book and novel adaptations. This has lead several people to believe they actually saw the scenes on the silver screen. All of the scenes were included on the CD-Rom Star Wars: Behind the Magic in 1998. A reunion scene between Luke and Biggs at the Rebel base was included in the Special Edition re-release of the movie. However, a line by Red Leader about having once met Luke's father was cut from this exchange. This is the opening sentence for a 13-page treatment 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) wrote in 1972: '...the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a Padawaan learner to the famed Jedi...' 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) spent nearly three years rewriting before he completed the script for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). Although most of that early script was ultimately unused, the character of Mace Windu and the term padawaan (with the spelling changed to padawan), both appear in the prequel trilogy. Mace Windu, of course, is one of the Jedi Council members, played by 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv). And the term padawan is used to refer to Jedi apprentices. The only movie, out of all six, when one of the characters refers to the droids as 'robots' on screen. The admiral whom Vader chokes is named Conan Antonio Motti. He is also Grand Moff Tarkin's brother-in-law. The sounds of the lasers were made by striking a metal wrench up the steel re-enforcement cables of a high-voltage electricity pylon - those long lines of power pylons that criss-cross most countries. The Millenium Falcon 'shutdown' engine noise was sourced from an external air-conditioning unit on its last legs. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) waived the normal writer/director fee and asked for a mere $175,000 plus 40% of the merchandising rights. After the failure of _Doctor Dolittle (1967)_, when its massive merchandising push proved an equally costly debacle, studio executives saw little if any profit from such matters and , agreed. _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) related merchandise has since generated many millions of dollars in sales, allowing Lucas to make movies completely independent of the studio system he decried. Merchandising rights are now a major part of any film contract. At one point when the prospects for the movie's release seemed bleakest, the idea came up that perhaps the effects could be removed from the movie and recycled into a TV show. 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) held his breath for so long during the trash compactor scene that he broke a blood vessel in his face. Subsequent shots are from one side only. The music by 'John Williams (I)' (qv) is ranked #1 on AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores. Upon receiving the script prior to her audition, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) read it aloud with her friend, actor 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv). Struck by how unique the story was, Fisher decided to lobby hard for the role of Princess Leia - a decision which paid off. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) originally prepared a 14-page story treatment for his space opera. The major studios all rejected it because they viewed it as science fiction which was very difficult to market at the time. Lucas did find one sympathetic ear - 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv), the then new head of 20th Century Fox, who had been impressed with Lucas's efforts on _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). It was Ladd who eventually greenlit the movie, to the tune of an $8,000,000 budget. 'Terri Lynn (I)' (qv) and 'Cindy Williams (I)' (qv) auditioned for the role of Princess Leia. Before casting 'Alec Guinness' (qv) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) considered casting Japanese actor 'Toshir? Mifune' (qv). He also considered making casting a Japanese Princess Leia. First of 18 consecutive films with Dolby-encoded soundtracks to win Academy Awards for Best Achievement in Sound. The line 'May the Force be with you.' is ranked #8 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. While speaking at London's National Film Theatre in 2009, 'Ben Burtt' (qv) disclosed that the alien gibberish sprouted by the Mos Eisley spy Garindan/Long Snoot in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) was actually the processed voice of 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). The hilt of the lightsaber given to Luke Skywalker is a Graflex 3 Cell Camera flash tube with some rubber grips and a loop attached to the base, these flash tubes can still be bought today but cost around the same as an official replica hilt. When 20th Century Fox attempted to distribute the film in the U.S., fewer than 40 theaters agreed to show it. As a solution, Fox threatened that any cinema that refused to show _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) would not be given the rights to screen the potential blockbuster _The Other Side of Midnight (1977)_ (qv) (which ended up grossing less than 10% of what Star Wars did). Although the Anchorhead scenes featuring 'Anthony Forrest (I)' (qv) as Fixer and 'Koo Stark' (qv) as Cammie were deleted, Forrest still appears in the finished film. He played the Sandtrooper who stops Luke and Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley and is then deluded by Obi-Wan's use of the Force. The 'TIE' in TIE Fighter is an acronym. It stands for 'Twin Ion Engines'. Modelmaker 'Joe Johnston (I)' (qv) came up with this acronym. In 'The Making of Star Wars' book he mentions another possibility had been 'Third Intergalactic Empire'. The original teaser trailer was narrated by 'Malachi Throne' (qv). In the documentary _Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy (2004) (TV)_ (qv), he is given a 'special thanks' credit. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) came up with the name R2-D2 during post-production of _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv). One of the sound crew wanted Lucas to retrieve Reel #2 of the Second Dialogue track. In post-production parlance, this came out as 'could you get R2-D2 for me?'. Lucas liked the sound of that and noted it down for future use. In Italy, R2-D2 was renamed C1-P8 while Darth Vader became Lord Fener, the reason being that 'Vader' in Italian sounds too close to the common noun for the toilet bowl (the 'water', clearly from the English 'water closet'). The 'clones' mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi became 'quotes' (Italian: 'cloni'/'quoti'). In the Blockade Runner scenes at the beginning of the film, with the shootout in the white hallways, only a single white hallway was built. It was filmed from multiple angles to give the impression that the 'ship' was bigger than it really was, and so that the best parts of the battle footage could be used more than once. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) started writing the screenplay in 1974. In the original draft, Luke made a failed Death Star Trench bombing attempt before making his shot that ultimately destroyed the station. While all footage of the first trench run was eliminated from the final movie, one line that referenced the first run remained - 'They're coming much faster THIS TIME.' Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) spent most of the production period in chaos, attempting to create special effects that had never been created before. They blew half their budget on four shots which 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) rejected. Ultimately, around $5,000,000 of the $8,000,000 budget was spent by ILM. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv)'s breasts were taped down with gaffer tape, as her costume did not permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. She joked later, 'As we all know, there is no underwear in space.' This film is ranked #2 on the AFI's top 10 science fiction films. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) based the character of Han Solo on his friend, director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). In the Italian version of the trilogy, the Death Star is called La Morte Nera (Black Death), and Darth Vader is called Lord Fener. 'James Earl Jones' (qv) supplied the voice of Darth Vader, but specifically requested that he not be credited. At the time, the reason he cited was that he felt he had not done enough work to get the billing, but he later admitted that he didn't want his name associated with the film because he was still an up-and-coming actor, and didn't want to be typecast. Jones does receive billing in the 1997 'Special Edition'. In its May 30, 1977 issue, Time magazine voted _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) 'The Year's Best Movie.' The franchise would go on to feature on the magazine's cover six times. Remains one of the 50 highest grossing movies of all time (as of 2010 at #30) without adjusting dollars for inflation and is the oldest film to have such distinction. In an earlier version of the script, the Millennium Falcon lands on not the Death Star but at a Cloud City that floats above the gaseous surface of the planet Alderaan. The rescue of Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader take place at this base, not on the Death Star. A cut in the budget for the movie forced 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to bring in the Death Star early, and in the finished film the scenes that would have take place in the Cloud City take place there, instead. The Cloud City, of course, was later used in _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv) . Since Alderaan was destroyed in _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv), however, it obviously couldn't be the location of the Cloud City. So a new planet was created to house the Cloud City: Bespin. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had not originally intended to use 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv)'s voice for the voice of C-3PO. He only changed his mind after a suggestion by 'Stan Freberg' (qv), one of the actors considered as Daniels' replacement Daniels' voice was altered in post-production. His character was supposed to be like a 'used-car salesman'. Ultimately, though, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was won over by the charisma of Daniels' reading of the part as a 'snooty British butler' and so Daniels has done the voice for C3PO ever since. The studio was unhappy with 'Star Wars' as a title after negative market testing. A competition was held during shooting for cast and crew to come up with a better one but nothing stuck. During production, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) referred to the film as a 'Disney movie,' trying to capture the whimsy of classic 1950s Disney family films. Ironically, more than 30 years after the release of the film, the Walt Disney Company would acquire LucasFilm, Lucas' production company, including all rights to the 'Star Wars' stories and characters for $4 billion; thus the film actually became a Disney movie. While 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was filming on location in Tunisia, the Libyan government became worried about a massive military vehicle parked near the Libyan border. Consequently, the Tunisian government, receiving threats of military mobilization, politely asked Lucas to move his Jawa sandcrawler farther away from the border. Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked #14 and #37 respectively on the 'Heroes' section of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, making _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) the only film to have more than one character on the list. Director 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had trouble getting funding for this movie, most studios (including Universal and United Artists) thinking that people wouldn't go to see it. Obi-Wan never says 'may the Force be with you'; he always says a close variation of the line. General Dodonna, however, does speak the line, while addressing the assembled rebels. 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) was offered the role of Princess Leia. At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had planned the character of Han Solo to be a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and gills. Then Lucas changed the idea of Han Solo to a black human. He auditioned several black actors and even musicians (including 'Billy Dee Williams' (qv)) until finally settling on 'Glynn Turman' (qv). But after this he decided to make the role white. 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv), 'Nick Nolte' (qv), 'Christopher Walken' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), 'Bill Murray (I)' (qv), 'Robert Englund' (qv), 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv), 'John Travolta' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv) were all candidates for the role of Han Solo. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) also wanted to stay away from any actors he had previously used in his films. 'James Caan (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Burt Reynolds (I)' (qv) turned down the role. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) (who had played Bob Falfa in Lucas's _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv)) read the part of Han Solo for screen tests of other characters but wasn't originally considered for the part. During these tests Lucas realized Ford was perfect for the role. Two different basic designs were created for the Millennium Falcon. The rejected one became the Rebel Blockade Runner seen at the start of the film. The character name Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to allude to the following definitions. OBI - a form of belief involving sorcery, practiced in parts of the West Indies, South America, the southern U.S., and Africa. And a charm used in this belief system. WAN - Archaically meaning dark or gloomy; also pale in color or hue, meaning decline in ability (referring to dotage of the aging Jedi). KEN - knowledge, understanding, or cognizance; mental perception. range of sight or vision. According to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv), during the making of the film, he and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) would usually fool around and not commit to their work whenever 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was not on set. When Guinness was on set, they behaved much more professionally. Over 60% of this film was shot with a film that was so prone to fading, it was discontinued in the early '80s. C-3PO was originally scripted as a 'used car salesman' type, and designed after the robot from _Metropolis (1927)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) completed his role in a matter of days (May 8-12). Shooting lasted from March-June 1976, released one year later due to the extensive special effects. In the scene where Luke is attacked by a Tusken Raider, the moment where the raider ('Peter Diamond (I)' (qv) waves his weapon over his head with both hands in an up-and-down motion was actually created from a shot of him thrusting his weapon up once, run backwards and forward several times. In 2010, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) sent 'Damon Lindelof' (qv) and 'Carlton Cuse' (qv), the executive producers of TV's _'Lost' (2004)_ (qv), a letter congratulating them on the show's end and letting them in on some (possibly facetious) secrets about his development of the Star Wars movie series: 'Don't tell anyone ... but when 'Star Wars' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories - let's call them homages - and you've got a series.' CASTLE THUNDER: Heard various times in the film whenever laser bolts or other various weapons are fired. It's most well-known use in the film is when the Death Star blows up. The humorous moment when Chewbacca frightens a skittish mouse droid was thought up on set and not scripted. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) shot the opening sequence of the Storm Troopers bursting through the blockade runner door, and the ensuing battle against rebel troops, in two takes. While the action on set was over very quickly, Lucas used six cameras to capture it, thereby extending the length of the scene on screen. Since some cameras were in very tight and others wide, it is difficult to tell the various actions that were duplicated. In some Spanish subtitled releases, R2-D2 name appears subtitled as 'Arturito' or 'little Arthur' in Spanish, since the pronunciation is very closed resembled, this is also the case with C3-PO whose name is subtitled as 'Citripio', but that does not resembles anything in Spanish. According to an interview with 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), originally Luke was a girl, Han Solo was an Alien, the wookiees were called Jawas, and R2-D2 and C-3PO were called A-2 and C-3. According to 'Ben Burtt' (qv), the sounds Chewbacca makes have been made from a compilation of large mammals, mostly bears (he said one particular zoo-kept Grizzly Bear was an invaluable source of Chewbacca sounds). R2-D2's sounds are various people (mostly Burtt) making baby-like sounds or sometimes actually recordings of babies electronically manipulated to sound mechanic. In earlier versions of the script, the line 'There will be no escape for the Princess this time' was 'There will be no escape for the Captain this time.' (A reference to Captain Antilles, who Vader later strangles to death.) 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), where they came up with the idea for _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv). The movie opened in May 1977 and by November had dethroned _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) as the all-time box-office champ. It then was beaten by _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), but was back on top when it was re-released in 1997. It held that position until _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). At one point, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) planned for the characters of Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle, to be dwarves. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' decision to accept a lower salary on the film in exchange for full merchandising rights was considered a fool's gamble on his part. Toys based on movies had never been major money-earners (though some movie-toy combinations had done moderate retail returns) because of the long gap between when a movie would go through its theatrical run and when any products based on it would be available. But Star Wars was such a phenomenon that it reached the holiday 1977 sales period in full swing, and changed the way movies were merchandised forever. The model used for the rebel blockade runner (the first ship seen in the first scene of the film) has a tiny _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) movie poster and a tiny Playboy centerfold in its cockpit. These aren't visible on screen, though. While the shot where the escape pod leaves Leia's ship was the first ever completed by ILM, the first shot actually approved by 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) for the movie was a shot of the laser cannons in the Death Star trench. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s original choice for cinematographer was 'Geoffrey Unsworth' (qv), but Unsworth was committed to _A Bridge Too Far (1977)_ (qv). 'Gilbert Taylor (I)' (qv) was hired instead, but hated working on the project. Producer 'Gary Kurtz (I)' (qv) became concerned that Taylor was slowing production down and attempted to replace him with 'Harry Waxman' (qv), but the camera crew made it clear they would not work under Waxman, and Lucas told Kurtz that replacing Taylor would probably delay the film even further. The cast and crew's nickname for 'David Prowse' (qv) was Darth Farmer, because of his heavy Bristol accent. In early drafts of the script, R2-D2 could speak standard English, and had a rather foul vocabulary. Although all of Artoo's English speech was removed, many of C-3PO's reactions to it were left in. The planet Tatooine is never referred to by name throughout the entire showing of 'A New Hope'. It doesn't appear on the scroll at the beginning of the movie. When C-3PO says he doesn't know what planet they're on, Luke responds by saying 'If there's a Bright Center to the Universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from'. In the original trilogy, Tatooine isn't mentioned by name until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). It is referred to by name and visited in all subsequent movies and prequels. Among the first promotional licenses granted was to Marvel Comics, who published a Star Wars comic book series which ran for 107 issues from 1977-86. The first six issues were an adaption of the film, which included some deleted scenes from the film. The adaptation was also published in a tabloid sized Collector's Edition format. Before 'Alec Guinness' (qv) was cast as Obi Wan, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) briefly considered using 'Peter Cushing' (qv), who plays Tarkin. When Darth Vader crushes the neck of Captain Antilles, the actual sound you hear is of walnut shells being crushed. The same sound effect is used in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv), when Han Solo is freed from the carbonite. 'Malcolm Tierney' (qv)'s (Lt. Shann Childsen) voice was dubbed over. On opening weekend in 1977, the movie earned $1.554 million on fewer than 40 screens. In 1997, it made over $36 million on over 2,000 screens. Was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1976 release, but was pushed back five months as post-production (especially special effects) took longer than expected. Studio executives were concerned that the new 25th May 1977 release date would put the film's box office chances at risk as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv) would come out that same week. However, by the end of its initial theatrical run in the U.S., _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv) had grossed over twice as much as _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv). In the DVD commentary, 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) shares that she and a friend of hers read the script out loud....and both, in fact, wanted to play Han Solo! That, of course, was impossible since Han is a male character. But that didn't stop Carrie! As she puts it, the one character she COULD play was Princess Leia....and the rest, of course, is history! Unlike the other films in the series, this film features Grand Moff Tarkin ('Peter Cushing' (qv)) as the major Imperial villain, instead of Emperor Palpatine ('Ian McDiarmid' (qv)). Both of their names are references to the Roman Republic/Empire. The Tarquins were kings of Rome in the days before the Roman Republic. Palatine Hill was a major location in the city of Rome. The enhanced effects used for the Death Star explosions in the 1997 re-releases of this movie and _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) feature the 'Praxis Wave,' so named for its first use by Industrial Light and Magic in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv) for the explosion of the Klingon moon, Praxis. The reason the screen 'whites up' as Ben and Luke carry C-3P0 to repair him after the Sand People attack is that 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) was only wearing black tights below the waist. 'William Katt' (qv) auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker. Han Solo's blaster was manufactured from a 'Broomhandle' Mauser Pistol. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In the early mono mix of the film, a few lines are slightly different, or completely different vocal takes. For instance, a different actress dubbed Aunt Beru's lines in the earlier mono mix. Likewise, Luke's line 'Blast it Biggs, where are you' in the Death Star battle was 'Blast it Wedge, where are you' in the mono version. Although the mono mix is less common, the version of the latter line in it may seem to make more sense, since Wedge was the one who did eventually save Luke in that point of the battle. However, in the chaos of such a large-scale dogfight, either version would be acceptable, since Luke might not have known that Biggs was otherwise occupied and Wedge was free to come to his aid. The term 'Moff', used to describe some Imperial characters (such as Tarkin) is used to mean a regional governor of a specific sector of space. Military officers can also be Moffs - Tarkin, for example, is listed in the script as an Admiral in the Imperial fleet. The briefing of the pilots and the final dogfights at the Death Star were inspired by many WWII films including _Flying Tigers (1942)_ (qv), _Flying Leathernecks (1951)_ (qv) and _Battle of Britain (1969)_ (qv) amongst others. Though the only thing Chewbacca can say from start to finish is a Wookiee growl, he has the last line in the film. The language spoken by the Jawas was created by recording speakers of the African Zulu language and electronically speeding it up. Greedo's language is the Peruvian Indian language Quechua, played backwards. ('George Lucas (I)' (qv) would later feature Peruvian Indians again in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv)). The weapons the stormtroopers used were essentially the Sterling L2A3 9mm SMG (sub-machine gun) a military weapon developed in the late 1940s in the UK and adopted by the British and Canadian Armies in the 1950s. The curved left entry side mounted magazine was removed. And that was as much as it was modified for the film. The longer sandtrooper weapon was the MG-34 machine gun from Germany. 'Perry King' (qv) screen-tested for the role of Han Solo. Though he lost the part to 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) for the film, he got to play Solo in the National Public Radio adaptations of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. A great deal of the film was shot by vintage 1950s VistaVision cameras, because they were of higher quality than any others available. After the film was released, the prices of these cameras skyrocketed. 'Willard Huyck' (qv) and 'Gloria Katz' (qv), old film-school friends of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv), did uncredited rewrites on the screenplay. 20th Century Fox refused to pay them a fee, insisting that Lucas pay them out of his own salary. He eventually gave them some of his own profit points as a reward. The rebel General who talks to Princess Leia on her arrival at Yavin IV is named 'Willard' after Huyck. Darth Vader's breathing was originally meant to be much more labored and raspy. The sound of this labored, raspy breathing would be used later on in _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv) during that movie's climax. 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s script evolved into a mammoth 200 page screenplay. Having spent a full year writing it, he was reluctant to condense it so instead he chose to concentrate on the first third, with a view to expanding the remaining two thirds into two additional films. Stunt doubles were not used for the scene in which Luke and Leia swing to safety. 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) and 'Mark Hamill (I)' (qv) performed that stunt themselves, shooting it in just one take. 'Denis Lawson' (qv), who played Wedge Antilles (his name is misspelt in the credits as 'Dennis Lawson'), is the uncle of 'Ewan McGregor' (qv), who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels. See also _Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_ (qv). 'Peter Cushing' (qv) found the boots that came with his costume extremely uncomfortable to wear because they were too small for his feet. Thus he only wore them in the few shots in which Tarkin's feet could be seen. In all other shots, 'Peter Cushing' (qv) wore a pair of fuzzy slippers. The movie's line 'May the force be with you.' was voted as the #22 of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Lines' by Premiere in 2007. When the film was re-released in theaters after it became so successful, the Daffy Duck cartoon _Duck Dodgers in the 24?th Century (1953)_ (qv) was run preceding the feature at the request of 'George Lucas (I)' (qv). 'Carrie Fisher' (qv) found the dialogue to be very difficult, later saying, 'You can type this stuff, but you can't say it'. 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) had similar trouble (particularly in the scene where the Millenium Falcon leaves Tatooine), and persuaded 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) to let him change several lines. 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay largely because 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had hired conceptual artist 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv) to create paintings of a number of scenes to help sell it in. The actors playing the stormtroopers in the scene where they investigate the escape pod were paid 8500 Tunisian Dinar, which back then was the equivalent of only US$6.50 in 1976 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be US$24.76 in 2010 dollars. In 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)' paperback novelization of the film, the book begins with a short prologue recited by Princess Leia. In the prologue, she tells the story of the fall of the 'Old Republic', the rise of the Empire, and the rise of the Rebel Alliance. This would be part of the basis for Episodes 1-3 of the 'New Trilogy'. The cantina creature later to be known as 'Dice Ibegon' was really nothing more than a hand puppet known as the 'Drooling arm'. This was because it was fashioned to have a red, oozy liquid drip from it's mouth. When they tried this on film however, the liquid spurted all over the place and the shot was judged to be too disgusting for a PG movie. 'Alan Ladd Jr.' (qv) was very anxious when he attended the premiere in Japan, only to be met by total silence at the end. What Ladd didn't realize was that Japanese moviegoers typically wait for a film's end titles to finish before speaking or leaving the theater. The first science fiction film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. WILHELM SCREAM: The film revived and re-popularized the 'Wilhelm Scream' sound effect, first used in _Distant Drums (1951)_ (qv). Chewbacca was modeled after 'George Lucas (I)' (qv)'s dog, Indiana. See also _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv). This is the only film in the series where 'David Prowse' (qv) did the lightsaber fighting on his own; he was doubled in the sequels because he kept breaking the poles that stood in for the blades. This switch might explain why Vader pivots on his feet in this film, but not in the others. The rescue of the Princess - and Obi-Wan Kenobi's duel with Darth Vader - were originally intended to take place on Alderaan. In some scenes that were filmed but never used, the filmmakers had to use multiple models of R2-D2, since he had a hard time keeping up with the other characters. When one could no longer keep up, a second one hidden behind a corner or wall would 'sneak' back into the main group. As this charade wasn't very convincing, none of these scenes made the final cut. 'Ben Burtt' (qv) created the sound of Darth Vader's breathing by placing a small microphone in the second stage (mouthpiece) of a scuba regulator, and then recording the sound made by his breathing through the regulator. The famous Darth Vader suit was designed by production designer 'Ralph McQuarrie' (qv), who was concerned about the character being able to breathe while he was traveling from his spaceship to Princess Leia's spaceship. It was not explained why Darth Vader wears the suit at all times until _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). The look of the Darth Vader suit was based on robes worn by Bedouin Warriors. The final version of the opening crawl for this movie was co-written by 'Brian De Palma' (qv) after complaining that the previous (third draft) version was too difficult to understand. According to the exhibit at the Smithsonian, the sound of a TIE fighter is created by combining the squeal of a young elephant with the sound of a car driving by on a rain-slicked highway. Initial research from 20th Century Fox using the title and a brief synopsis came back with the results that only males under 25 were interested in seeing the film. Fox then deliberately marketed the film with a view to attracting older and female cinemagoers by pushing images of humans (including Princess Leia) centerstage and referring to the film in more mythic tones, rather than science fiction. When writing the script, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had terrible trouble remembering how to spell all the odd names he had invented for his universe. This explains why there is such inconsistency over the way Wookiee is spelled. During the scene where Han Solo and the others emerge from the Millennium Falcon's secret compartments, 'John Williams (I)' (qv) wrote a 3-note motif for the accompanied soundtrack. This 3-note motif is a cue from _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). As a friend and colleague of 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv), who wrote the music for _Psycho (1960)_ (qv), 'John Williams (I)' (qv) included this particular cue as an homage to 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv). SOURCE: 'The Making of Psycho' documentary which can be found in the Bonus Materials section on the 'Psycho (1960) Collector's Edition' DVD. The 1:16 mark of the documentary reveals this information. SPOILER: 'Vader,' pronounced differently, is the Netherlands Dutch word for 'father'. 'Darth' is a made-up word, probably an abbreviation for Dark Lord of the Sith. Production was so laden with problems that 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) worked himself into poor health. He had to be checked into the hospital after suffering from hypertension. The terms 'X-wing' and 'Y-wing' and 'TIE fighter' were used by ILM effects guys to distinguish the fighters. These terms are not used in this film, though they were incorporated into the sequels. They also became popular with the public after the toys and the Making of special aired on tv. In addition, ILM's special effects staff nicknamed the Millennium Falcon 'The Porkburger' but this never caught on. When the storm troopers enter the room where C-3PO and R2-D2 are hiding, one of the actors accidentally bumps his head on the doorway due to his limited visibility. When the Special Edition came out in 1997, a sound effect had been added to the scene to accompany the head bump. 'David Prowse' (qv) was not the only on-screen actor to have his voice overdubbed by another. In the early rough-cut of the Cantina sequence, Wuher, the barkeeper is speaking in a very pronounced Cockney accent, one that was overdubbed by an American actor before the film's release. The same also happens with the character of Dr. Evazan ('I have the death sentence in 12 systems!') for much the same reason. Voted number 9 in Channel 4's (UK) 'Greatest Family Films' During production, 'Anthony Daniels (I)' (qv) and all other actors playing 'C-3PO'-type droids had to lean against a board to rest, as his costume was not flexible enough to allow them to sit. In scenes where C-3PO is required to sit, Daniels' costume had to be partially disassembled to allow him to sit down. This was hidden by using camera angles, and by having C-3PO sit behind things. This inflexible costume problem was also experienced by actor 'Jack Haley (I)' (qv) who played the Tin Woodsman in _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) and 'David Prowse' (qv) were both given a choice as to which giant character they wanted to play, Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Mayhew wanted to play a good guy and Prowse wanted to play a bad guy, so they ended up playing the matching characters. 'David Prowse' (qv), the actor in the Darth Vader suit, was still disgruntled more than 20 years after the film's release about the fact that his voice was replaced by 'James Earl Jones' (qv). In an interview with the Canadian press, Prowse claimed that he was a victim of 'reverse racism'. As there were no black members in the cast, the studio was worried that they would lose a significant size audience. Portions of the sound effects for the Millennium Falcon's engines were recorded at an air show at the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention in Oshkosh, WI. In a gesture of thanks, Lucasfilm donated a model of the Falcon to the EAA Air Museum. The Millennium Falcon was originally modeled after a hamburger with an olive next to it. Because the name of the ship had not been finalized at this time, storyboards refer to as the pirate ship. Some boards indicate for the first version of the pirate ship (which became the Blockade Runner) to be changed into the 'Hamburger Boogie' version. Darth Vader has only 12 minutes of screen time. According to Star Wars canon, Tatooine's twin suns heat the planet so much that only the polar regions are habitable. Came fourth in the UK's Ultimate Film, in which films were placed in order of how many seats they sold at cinemas When Luke and his aunt and uncle are eating they are using a white set of glasses and pitcher. These are a Tupperware style.

He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable 'Death Star' capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2-D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2-D2 ends up on the Skywalkers' farm with his friend C-3PO. R2-D2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever? Part IV in George Lucas' epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a Rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farm boy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a Rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empire's most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star. In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy. Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil forces of the Galactic Empire in their effort to take over the galaxy. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing Captain Han Solo team together with the lovable robotic duo, R2-D2 and C-3PO, to rescue the beautiful princess and restore justice in the galaxy. The 'lost scenes' from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the 'Behind the Magic' CD-ROM-discs. The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases 'twenty percent' and 'fifteen percent' are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as '20%' and '15%,' to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version. In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films. ORALL47 The German 'marketing film' released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German 'UFA' released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the 'marketing film' version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US 'Ken Films' version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the 'marketing/UFA'-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes. The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the 'A New Hope' subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date. There are at least two different prints of the original Star Wars in circulation. One definite difference between them is that the brief scene in the Death Star corridor where Chewbacca roars and 'frightens' a little messenger droid is missing. This scene was NOT in the 'opening day' version. The 2006 DVD reissue contains a 'bonus disc' which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the 'Episode IV: A New Hope' subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's 'tractor beam description' and Stormtrooper 'close the blast doors' lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD. In 1977, 'Ken Films' released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company 'Derran' released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies). The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the 'close the blast doors' line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line 'All his friends have gone' places emphasis on 'friends' rather than 'gone' in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?' rather than 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected. David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten print of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences, and had deteriorated all the way to black & white. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit.  All the landspeeder, Millenium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded.  The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes. When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: 'I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.' In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. 'Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you' was split into 'Jabba put a price so big on your head...' followed by, 'every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.' The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible. Stills from the 'lost' Tatooine scenes have been published (in 'The Star Wars Storybook', for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars''.  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story. In the 1997 re-release, two of the Cantina Aliens that had werewolf heads have been replaced. One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases: - The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the Battle of Yavin is very different. - On TV, Luke says 'Blast it, Wedge, where are you?'  On the video he says, 'Blast it, Biggs, where are you?' - On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out. - On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, 'This one's secure, move onto the next one'.  On the video he says 'locked' instead of secure. The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints. In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say 'Open the blast door. Open the blast door' as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say 'Close the blast door' before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was 'lost' on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled 'The Story of Star Wars.' This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The 'close the blast doors' line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special 'George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic' on the PBS series _'American Masters' (1983)_ (qv). Coming to your galaxy this summer.  (Teaser poster) May the Force be with you (re-release) It's Back! (re-release) The force will be with you (re-release) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask. CHAR: As Luke cleans R2-D2, watch C-3PO in the background. When Luke jumps back, surprised by Princess Leia's message, C-3PO slips off the steps (but recovers in time not to ruin the shot). CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs. CONT: In the scene with the oil bath in Luke's garage, C3PO is holding a rag. We cut away to R2D2, then cut back to C3PO, and the rag is gone. Then cut to R2D2 again and cut back to C3PO, then the rag is back. FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of 'midichlorians' because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention. SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement. However, only a few actors (visible on the left side of the aisle) actually stomp their feet after making their turn. FAKE: During a gun battle just before Luke and Han Solo escape down the garbage chute, some close-ups of Luke and Han show flesh-colored make-up smeared from under their chins onto the white plastic Imperial armor they are wearing. These makeup smears do not appear in longer shots, but show up in a couple of close shots during the scene. CONT: When the Falcon is escaping the Death Star, they are pursued by four fighter craft. After three of the fighters are destroyed, what should be the lone remaining craft is next seen accompanied by another. The second craft apparently reassembles itself just long enough for this one fly-by, as it is not seen again (this was corrected in the Special Edition, as only one TIE fighter is visible in the shot). CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole. FAKE: When the Jawas come to the homestead, one of the shots has a tall Jawa tinkering with one of the droids with 'normal-sized' Jawas in the foreground. FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. Again, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that. FACT: 'Denis Lawson' (qv)'s name is misspelled 'Dennis' in the credits, and was not fixed in the 1997 special edition. CONT: The windows of the TIE fighters are shaped differently when viewed from the inside and the outside. FAKE: When R2 is being picked up by the Jawas after he is stunned and has fallen onto his face, a Jawa's sleeve pulls up revealing a portion of the actor's bare forearm. SYNC: When Luke, Ben, and the droids first enter the cantina and Wuher the bartender yells, 'Hey! We don't serve their kind here!' his voice does not match his lips. (See trivia.) CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases. CONT: When Luke is practicing with the lightsaber in the Millennium Falcon, his lightsaber is green. He turns it off to talk to Ben and when he turns it back on, it is back to its 'proper' light blue. This mistake is only in the 2004 DVD release. CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots. FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and thrown his body into a wall. The 'dead' man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact. CONT: Just after Leia has been rescued from her cell on the Death Star and says sarcastically, 'Great Rescue!' as they are being fired at, her fringe is smoothed away from her face. The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place. CONT: C-3PO sustains a dent on his head during the Sandpeople attack, but the dent appears, disappears, and swaps sides frequently during the movie. CONT: Red Leader's helmet mike switches sides several times just before he crashes. FAKE: At the end of the movie, many of the gathered soldiers are plainly cardboard cutouts. CONT: The pitcher in Luke's hand while he is talking to Uncle Owen changes hands a few times. FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume. FAKE: Just before Leia and Luke swing across the chasm in the Death Star (and at other times), the 'blasters' they are shooting are seen to eject shell casings. This is because the guns used in the movie are just dressed-up blank-firing prop guns. CONT: Luke's sleeve and the position of his head and arms when he is lying unconscious after the Sandpeople attack. CONT: In the Death Star conference, the back of Tarkin's chair is higher in the wide shots than it is in the close-ups. FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side. CONT: The blue panels on R2-D2 appear black when he is in the X-Wing with Luke in space. This is a blue screen shot which effectively makes R2's panels transparent. In the Special Edition, they left them as black but the newly added CGI X-Wing shots with R2-D2 are blue. FAKE: When Luke, Ben, and the droids are in the landspeeder approaching the stormtroopers at Mos Eisley just prior to the famous scene 'These aren't the droids you're looking for' the starboard engine cover is clearly empty. CONT: When C-3PO is separated from R2-D2 on Tatooine and walking among the sand dunes, clear skies and cloudy skies keep trading places between shots. CREW: When Han is going to the falcon,you can see the shadow of a crew member walk up to him. FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image. FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots. FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember 'owning a droid', which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.) FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled. CONT: Footage of R2-D2 turning his head skeptically during the Jawa auction is used twice. CONT: After a Stormtrooper stuns Leia in the opening scene, he walks over to inspect her. However, when he tells his companions to inform Lord Vader, the stripes on the tube-like part of his helmet are missing. CONT: In the escape from Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan is visible in the background, out of position, with a green light shining on his white shirt, making it appear green. CONT: When 3PO explains how the tractor beam is powered (in later versions like the Special Edition only), his voice is of a higher pitch than in the rest of the film, indicating an obvious dub. FAKE: When Luke is searching for the runaway R2D2, a rope can be seen dragging a droid that passes in the foreground from right to left. CONT: Just after R5D4 'blows a fuse' when the droids are purchased from the Jawas and C3PO recommends R2D2, we see R5D4 behind R2 (as R2D2 stands against the sandcrawler). In the next shot, R5D4 is once again beside C3PO being taken back by the Jawas. CONT: As Luke prepares to board his fighter prior to the climactic space battle, he brushes his hand along the underside of the wing. The markings on the wing clearly indicate it is 'Red One,' shown by the one red stripe. However, during the battle it is repeatedly established that Luke is in fact 'Red Five,' and exterior shots of the spacecraft model have five red stripes. This is corrected in the special edition by adding the scene of Luke talking to Biggs. They start talking under red one and continue to walk to Luke's fighter. This scene was cut from the original. CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler. CONT: When Ben gives Luke the lightsaber, and Luke activates it, the cape hanging on the wall behind him disappears while the saber is active, and re-appears when it is shut off. CONT: When Luke returns to the Lars homestead to find it destroyed, in all shots from behind Luke (or from his point of view) the wind is blowing from his left; all shots facing Luke show it blowing from his right. CONT: The windows at the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon do not match when viewed from outside and when viewed from inside. FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: 'Red 6, can you see Red 5?' and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment. FAKE: When Darth Vader releases Admiral Motti and he slumps on the desk, the force of the impact makes the whole set wobble. CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes. FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing. CONT: In the scene where C-3PO and R2-D2 take over the control room, three guns are leaning against the little window that overlooks the hanger. But in a few different shots, there are four guns. CONT: When Han, Luke, and Leia meet the group of stormtroopers just after seeing the Millenium Falcon, Leia's hair is falling apart, but when they meet up again at the ship, it has been fixed. CONT: When R2D2 and C-3PO are in the escape pod, the rotation of the pod and the view rearward of the star cruiser don't agree. CONT: The hologram of Leia that Luke discovers changes for one repetition as Luke and C3PO discuss it. FAKE: Rubber sole of Chewbacca's foot visible as he follows Han Solo in the Death Star. CONT: In the trash compactor, the metal bar that Leia uses to try and brace the walls is buried in debris. When she needs it moments later she is already resting her hands on it and it is easily obtainable. FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike. CONT: For the 1997 Special Edition, Industrial Light and Magic made CG models of the X-Wings (based on the 'Red 2' filming model, Wedge's ship) and the Millennium Falcon (based on the filming model built for _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv)). Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme). CONT: In the first shot of the Millennium Falcon, the ship is missing its radar dish. SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing. 'Anthony Daniels' in costume saying 'Oh my! Artoo!' in the audio track. Shortly thereafter, C-3PO's proper 'Oh my! Artoo!' (replete with robotic audio effect) is heard. FACT: Throughout the film, we see loud, fiery explosions taking place in outer space. In order for sound to travel and fire to thrive, there must be atmospheric oxygen present. Since there is no oxygen in space, these loud and fiery explosions are not possible. FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick. The lightsaber's red glow is gone and you can clearly see the white pole as the actors used it on the set. This mistake has been corrected for the CGI-enhanced special edition and DVD edition, but is still visible in the old VHS and Laser Disc versions. CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction. FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. FAKE: The arm of the crane supporting the floating torture device is visible for a second or two when it enters Leia's cell. The needle on the device bears the letters 'British Made'. FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed. CONT: When Vader is strangling Captain Raymus Antilles, a stormtrooper in the background holds his blaster at waist level in one shot and chest level in another. FACT: Long-distance travel in the Star Wars galaxy is variously referred to as 'going to lightspeed' (the Millenium Falcon can make 'point-five above lightspeed', according to Han) or 'making the jump into hyperspace' using a 'hyperdrive', even when talking about a single vessel. These are two completely different concepts for reducing the travel time between star systems: in everyday terms, it is like equating 'drive faster' with 'take a shortcut' as ways to get to your destination sooner. CONT: When leaving the Yavin base, many of the rebel pilots are wearing brand new helmets. In the scenes that follow the helmets are clearly old and battered. FAKE: At the start of the Vader vs. Ben lightsaber battle, when Ben turns his on, a cord can be seen that runs up Ben's sleeve. CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: 'Come on!' and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen. FAKE: At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into it with two criminals and gets thrown at a wall. Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually 'seal' the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out. FACT: A laser fires at the speed of light, and would not appear as pulses of energy like projectile weapons, but would instead instantly connect the gun with the target. FAKE: Leia blasts a hole in the wall to escape the detention level, leaving the remains of bars at the top of the hole. When Luke jumps down the garbage chute, his feet hit the bars lightly, making them shake, since they are made of foam. CONT: On the way to the turbo lift to the detention area, the position of the rifle Han Solo (dressed as a stormtrooper) jumps from shot to shot. CONT: After C-3PO and R2-D2 escape from the Blockade Runner, the Blockade Runner has vanished from the Star Destroyer's underside tractor beam hatch. This is most evident in the last frame of the scene that shows the Star Destroyer flying by. CONT: A cloud appears over one of Tatooine's suns too quickly. FAIR: During the final Death Star battle, Red Leader says, 'Stay there, I just lost my starboard engine' shortly before we see his fighter get hit. However, he may not have lost it due to a hit; it may have had a mechanical failure that just came at a really bad time. FAIR: Although Tatooine has two suns, the angular distance between them is quite small, so only very large objects would cast two distinct shadows. SYNC: When the rebel ship at the beginning of the movie falls into the tracker beam of the star destroyer, inside the rebel ship the rebels look up as the ship makes clanking sounds (presumably during docking). The next scene shows the two ships still far apart, drawing nearer, but obviously not close to touching. SYNC: When Darth Vader says to Tarkin, 'I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,' he then continues to gesture as if still talking. FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it 'made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.' A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance. FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself. CONT: In the original theatrical release, there is the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin gives the order to destroy Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan. But when the laser bolt from the Death Star is fired at Alderaan, two separate explosions take place, not one, and some rubble that is fired from the planet during the first explosion disappears when the second explosion is taking place. CHAR: When C-3PO and R2-D2 are in the control room of the Death Star, the storm troopers barge in, and one hits his head on the door. This goof was highlighted in the remastered version with a comedy 'donk' sound effect. FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release. FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 'there will be no escape for the Princess this time.' (The script reads 'There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,' foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess. FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying 'You should not have come back' is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left. CONT: Items on Ben's table as he watches the hologram. FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there. CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet. CONT: C3PO tells Luke Sywalker, as Luke is about to get his father's lightsaber from Ben, he is going to shut down if not needed anymore. His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber. SYNC: Just before Alderaan is destroyed, Governor Tarkin asks the Princess 'You would prefer another target, a military target, then name the system!' In the reaction shot of the Princess you can see Tarkin's mouth moving but there is no sound. SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, 'Carrie!' when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher' (qv)) call 'Luke!' Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be 'Hey' or 'Yay'; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, 'Hey! There she is!' but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie. FAKE: When Luke activates his light saber after Obi Wan gives it to him, the reflection on C3P0 only shows the hilt, not the blue blade CONT: The shrubs on the edge of the hole in Luke's desert home. FAKE: When the stormtroopers raid the rebel corvette at the beginning of the film, there is an initial over-the-shoulder shot of the door Darth Vader walks through. A wire is visible on the far left part of the screen close to one of the rebel guard's helmet that is not seen in subsequent shots. (It is not a rigid wire, and, therefore, is not part of the helmet.) FAKE: During Kenobi's final lightsaber battle with Vader, Kenobi tips his lightsaber downwards, right before a scene change. The white 'glow' that should be there isn't, showing the stick-like prop the actors used in filming. There is a small white light at the tip, too. This was not fixed in the Special Edition, but it was finally fixed on the 2004 DVD. FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the 'laser divot' along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version. FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format. Rated PG for sci-fi violence and brief mild language Dolby 70 mm 6-Track January 1973 - 30 April 1977 To compensate for the new special edition credits inserted in versions 1997 and beyond, a longer instrumental suite plays during the credits roll, integrating various themes from throughout the film. The film has no opening credits. Instead, the first credits seen at the end of the film are presented in the order in which they would have otherwise been shown at the start. Although by the late 1990s it was commonplace for films to not have opening credits, in 1977 it was somewhat unusual for a major film to not have opening credits. When first released theatrically, prior to the film, a generic screen reading in green letters 'A Lucasfilm Limited Production' appeared. In all versions from the Special Edition onward, this is replaced with a more elaborate Lucasfilm logo that shines and glows. Lopes, Joao. 'Cartaz'.
