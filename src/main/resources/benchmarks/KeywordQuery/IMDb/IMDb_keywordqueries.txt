Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about. (2012) Print ads for Garnier's Nutrisse Nourishing Color Creme hair color. Fey, Elizabeth Stamatina Tina Fey. _Bossypants._ New York: Reagan Arthur Books, 2011. ISBN 0316056863 Elizabeth Stamatina Fey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, just west of Philadelphia, in 1970 to Donald and Jeannec Fey. Going by the name of Tina, Ms. Fey considered herself a 'supernerd' during her high school and college years. She studied drama at the University of Virginia, and after graduating in 1992, she headed to Chicago, the ancestral home of American comedy. While working at a YMCA to support herself, she started Second City's first set of courses. After about nine months, a teacher told her to just skip ahead and audition for the more selective Second City Training Center. She failed but about eight weeks later, she re-auditioned and got into the year-long program. She ended up spending many years at The Second City in Chicago where many SNL cast members first started out. Then in 1995, _'Saturday Night Live' (1975)_ (qv) came to The Second City's cast, including Fey's friend, 'Adam McKay (I)' (qv), as a writer, searching for new talent. What they found was Tina Fey. When Adam was made Head writer, he suggested Fey should send a submission packet over the summer with six sketches, 10 pages each. Tina took the advice and sent them. After 'Lorne Michaels' (qv) met her and saw her work she was offered a job a week later. She admitted that she was extremely nervous working in the legendary Studio 8H; being a foot shorter than everyone else, younger, and being one of the only female writers at the time. After a few years, Tina made history by becoming the first female head writer in the show's history. Tina also made her screen debut as a featured player during the 25th season by co-anchoring Weekend Update with 'Jimmy Fallon' (qv). Since Tina and Jimmy have taken over Weekend Update it has been considered the best ever. This year she made it to full fledged star by becoming a regular cast member, though she is hardly on the show, besides Update. And during the past two summers, Tina and 'Rachel Dratch' (qv) performed their two-woman show to critical acclaim in both Chicago (1999) and New York (2000) and made their Aspen Comedy Festival Debut. Tina is married to 'Jeff Richmond (II)' (qv), a Second City director and currently lives in New York City.

Video Game TV Movie Actor Writer actor actress Paul Benjamin   Samantha Bond birth notes gender other works name trivia birth date spouse height quotes 1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male 27 November 1961 'Alexander Hanson' (qv) (? - present); 2 children Samantha Bond Sister of 'Abigail Bond' (qv) 5' 6 1/2' 'As for 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) as Bond, I think it is an absolutely brilliant choice.

ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

Video Game Series Production Designer Genre actor genre  Paul Benjamin    1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central.

In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp.

As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

He would recall the names of cinematographers as they appeared on their films and call them blindly to talk with them about their work. Many of them were so suprised by this young man's ambition and interest that they took him under their wing, mentoring him. When he arrived in Los Angeles he spent every moment with them on their sets and homes learning as much about them and their work as he could. Because of this he was able to meet and befriend many of the greatest cinematographers in Hollywood. His key mentor was Harry Stradling Sr. Through him he developed friendships with Joseph Ruttenberg, George Folsey, James Wong Howe, Leon Shamroy, Frank Phillipd, Leonard South, and many many others. In the late 70s he began a life long process of interviewing cinematographers on video tape or film. A deep reverence for all that is old Hollywood remains a great part of his life and the memory of the behind the scene stories told him as a young man is an important basis for his life and work.

After Hurricane Andrew struck in August 1992, Jack headed to St. Petersburg, Florida. There, he attended Gibbs High School and The Pinellas County Center for the Arts (P.C.C.A) in 1996.  While in P.C.C.A. he pursued a wide range of visual arts including photography, oil painting, welding, rendering, sketching, design, sculpture art history and film history. Jack held an art exhibition in March of 2000, entitled 'Fear', which dealt with horror and its portrayal in motion pictures.  An interest in puppeteering led him to create his puppet, Stanley who quickly became very popular with cult audiences, making cameo appearances in some short films. The success of these shorts inspired Jack to write a full three-part screenplay about Stanley and create his first feature length film, 'Natural Born Stanley' which was released on December 19, 1997.  With the success of 'Natural Born Stanley' and intent on maintaining creative control over his future films, Jack channeled all of his efforts into creating his own production company.  The foundation of the company was set with his first film. Moviegod Productions was formed and with it came the much-anticipated sequel 'Stanley 2 - The Legacy', released on February 13, 1999. Along with the release of his second feature length film the 'M' logo for Moviegod Productions was created.  After 'Stanley 2 - The Legacy' he wrote and directed 'Lost in the Wilderness - Quest For Episode I' which opened on June 22, 2000 at the Film Paradiso Beach Theatre in St. Pete Beach, Florida. The premiere was an undisputed success, with lines forming around the theatre. The premiere with young and old moviegoers alike was almost sold out opening night.  The premiere included a display of behind the scenes photos, complimentary gifts for pre-purchase ticket holders, autographed pictures of the cast, movie-based merchandise and a live performance by 'Kill Theory', who played live music from the original motion picture soundtrack.  On December 24, 2000 Jack moved to Los Angeles, California after a seven-day cross country road trip, taking the newly restored and re-titled Moviegod Productions Entertainment with him.

The awards ceremony included both Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and was held at the Colony Theatre in Burbank, California. 'The Shortest Day' was nominated for four Archie Awards, of which it won three.  In 2005 Jack took a much needed two year break from filmmaking, writing and web building. He spent his personal time off mountain climbing, sight seeing, reading, soul searching, meditating, hiking, resting and learning about what ever he could get his hand on.  On February 16, 2007 Jack was ordained by Rose Ministries and became a Reverend capable of performing Weddings, Baptisms, Funerals and other spiritual and religious ceremonies.

ISBN 0749922362 Sean Bean, England's most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in 'Clarissa,' passionate lovers like Mellors in 'Lady Chatterley's Lover,' rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in 'The Lord of the Rings,' and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in 'Troy,' where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's 'Macbeth,' where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, 'I don't have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?' Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.

Video Game Composer Language TV Movie actress language Kelly McGillis     'Parade Magazine' (USA), November 1997, pg. 22, by: James Brady, 'In Step With: Kelly McGillis' 'Boyd Black' (14 April 1979 - 1981) (divorced) Wanted to play the role of 'Kathryn Murphy', the district attorney in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv), because she and her roommate were assaulted and raped by two men in their apartment in 1982. 'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

Work Person Writer director producer Jimmy Holcomb Steven Goldmann   Jimmy Holcomb James Terry Holcomb Jr. In 1998-1999, Steven Goldmann won the triple crown of the Country music video industry. His innovative direction of Faith Hill's 'This Kiss' took top prize with the Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music, and TNN Music City News Best Video of the Year. In addition, he was awarded Video of the Year by Country Music Television (CMT) and Nashville Music Awards for 'This Kiss.' The 1998 Music Row Awards Best Video of the Year and a Telly Award (Kathy Mattea's 'I'm On Your Side'), the 1998 MVPA (Music Video Production Association) Award for Country Video Of The Year (Mary Chapin Carpenter's 'Better To Dream Of You'), It was by all measurements a year to remember and a year that brought Goldmann to national prominence. It capped off a run of recognition in the music video world that started with consecutive (1996 and 1997) CMT Director of the Year Awards.  With almost 200 videos to his credit, Goldmann's reputation as a storyteller with distinct visual style has attracted such major stars as Bruce Springsteen, Alan Jackson, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Brooks and Dunn, and Shania Twain. It was Goldmann's four videos for Shania's 'The Woman in Me' album that helped propel her album to the thirteen million unit selling mark. In 1996, he was recognized by the Canadian Country Music Association for his direction of Shania's ('If You're Not In It For Love') I'm Outta Here' with Video of the Year honors, a Clio (a prestigious acknowledgment from the US Advertising industry) and a Telly Award (a national television broadcast award for creative excellence). Rolling Stone Magazine sighted Shania and Goldmann's video for 'You Win My Love' as the 5th most import/influential video of the 90's.  It was inevitable, that after all this acclamation, Goldmann would turn his sights beyond the music video industry. In 2000 Goldmann began principle photography on a fantasy musical 'Our Country' an IMAX film for Gaylord Entertainment. Featuring Lyle Lovett, The Dixie Chicks, Dwight Yoakum, Alan Jackson, Martina McBride, Dolly Parton, and over thirty other stars, the film was released in 2003 coinciding with yet another honor by the Academy of Country Music -- Video of the Year for the Alan Jackson video, 'Drive.'  With a script by Writer's Guild Of Canada winner for Best Feature Screenplay (Stardom, directed by Denys Arcand), J. Jacob Potashnik, Goldmann directed, '50 Odd Dollars,' a film noir inspired by Razor & Tie recording Artist, singer/songwriter Fred Eaglesmith's recording of the same name. The film has had a long and well-received broadcast run on CMT CANADA and has won Gold Awards at the Houston World Film Festival and the Alabama/UNA Television and Film Festival. 2004 found Goldmann directing episodes of 'Missing' starring Vivica Fox for Lifetime and Lions Gate Entertainment, while still finding time to win Best Video and Best Director honors at the Canadian Country Music Awards as well as being nominated for the CMT Awards Breakthrough Video of the Year for Universal recording artist Julie Roberts  Goldmann most recently brought his style and story telling ability to his debut feature film 'Broken Bridges,' starring Toby Keith, Kelly Preston, Tess Harper, and Burt Reynolds for CMT FILMS/Paramount.

Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).

Marrow, Tracy Lauren 16 February 1958 Ice Ice-T and Douglas Century. _Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption-from South Central to Hollywood._ New York: One World/Ballantine, 2011. ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

Video Game Company TV Movie Actor actor distributors  Paul Benjamin  Cinema International Corporation (CIC) [FI] name 1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Composer Episode Movie composer spoofed in   Nino Rota birth notes gender death date aka biographical movies name birth name mini biography birth date death notes article 3 December 1911 Born in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. In the meantime, he had become an 'enfant prodige', famous both as a composer and as an orchestra conductor. His first oratorio, 'L'infanzia di San Giovanni Battista,' was performed in Milan and Paris as early as 1923 and his lyrical comedy, 'Il Principe Porcaro,' was composed in 1926. From 1930 to 1932, Nino Rota lived in the USA. He won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Philadelphia where he attended classes in composition taught by Rosario Scalero and classes in orchestra taught by 'Fritz Reiner' (qv). He returned to Italy and earned a degree in literature from the University of Milan. In 1937, he began a teaching career that led to the directorship of the Bari Conservatory, a title he held from 1950 until his death in 1979. After his 'childhood' compositions, Nino Rota wrote the following operas: Ariodante (Parma 1942), Torquemada (1943), Il cappello di paglia di Firenze (Palermo 1955), I due timidi (RAI 1950, London 1953), La notte di un neurastenico (Premio Italia 1959, La Scala 1960), Lo scoiattolo in gamba (Venezia 1959), Aladino e la lampada magica (Naples 1968), La visita meravigliosa (Palermo 1970), Napoli milionaria (Spoleto Festival 1977). He also wrote the following ballets: La rappresentazione di Adamo ed Eva (Perugia 1957), La Strada (La Scala 1965), Aci e Galatea (Rome 1971), Le Moli?re imaginaire (Paris and Brussels 1976) and Amor di poeta (Brussels 1978) for Maurice B?jart. In addition, there are countless works for orchestra that have been performed since before World War II and are still performed by orchestras in every part of the world. His work in film dates back to the early forties. His filmography includes the names of virtually all of the noted directors of his time. First among these is 'Federico Fellini' (qv). He wrote all of the movie scores for Fellini's films from _Lo sceicco bianco (1952)_ (qv) in 1952 to _Prova d'orchestra (1978)_ (qv) in 1978. Other directors include 'Renato Castellani' (qv), 'Luchino Visconti' (qv), 'Franco Zeffirelli' (qv), 'Mario Monicelli' (qv), 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv) (Oscar for best original score for _The Godfather: Part II (1974)_ (qv)), 'King Vidor' (qv), 'Ren? Cl?ment' (qv), 'Edward Dmytryk' (qv), and 'Eduardo de Filippo'. He also composed the music for many theatre productions by Visconti, Zefirelli, and de Filippo. In February of 1995, the Nino Rota Foundation was established at Fondazione Cini of Venice, Italy. Cini specializes in the works of 20th century Italian composers and includes the estate of Casella.

Cassidy, Shaun Paul 27 September 1958 Connie Berman. _The Shaun Cassidy Scrapbook._ New York: Tempo Books, 1978. ISBN 0-448-14738-6 Shaun was born on September 27, 1958, and traveled with his parents when he was only six months old while they were doing shows. His parents were stage and screen actors 'Shirley Jones (I)' (qv) and 'Jack Cassidy (I)' (qv) who were both heavily involved in the business. When he was a pre-teen, he started a band called 'Every Mothers Dream' and when his mother and half-brother, 'David Cassidy (I)' (qv), were both starring in a musical TV sitcom called _'The Partridge Family' (1970)_ (qv), he asked his mom to put him in some episodes. However, she refused as she wanted to encourage him to concentrate on his schooling. He did appear as part of the chorus in many musical theatre productions. In 1972, he then sang in a punk rock band called 'The Longfellow,' which was short-lived, as his parents transferred him to a private school in Beverly Hills.  He had a chance to star with his mother as James Preston in a summer stock stage musical production of 'On A Clear Day You Can See Forever' to get a taste of acting. During his grad year, he decided to make some records in Germany and had a hit there called 'Morning Girl' and appeared in TV shows with his hit there as well as in Australia. Then, in late 1976, he signed up with agent Ruth Aarons and played Christopher Wentworth Hewlitt in a short independent film called _Born of Water (1976)_ (qv) and successfully auditioned for the role of Joe Hardy in _'The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries' (1977)_ (qv). Also, he had a dream of becoming a writer and re-wrote some of the scripts of the series to make it more suitable for him, which angered the producers of the show. On an episode of the show, he sang some numbers as his character in a local disco, which led to a number of hit 45s and albums.  In the 1980s, he made acting a primarily focus after his role in the movie of the week titled _Like Normal People (1979) (TV)_ (qv) which he was well credited in as the mentally challenged Roger Meyers as well as playing Dave Stohler in the short-lived series 'Breaking Away' (1980)_ based on the popular motion picture, which only 8 episodes were produced due to a writers strike. He then decided to learn the true craft of acting and pursued it on stage by starring in such productions like 'Mass Appeal,' 'The Subject Was Roses,' 'Diary of a Hunger Strike,' 'Dangerous Music,' 'Pass/Fail,' and 'Blood Brothers' with 'Petula Clark (I)' (qv) and his half-brother 'David Cassidy (I)' (qv) -- in their first show together. After a few more TV guest roles, movies of the week as well as acting on stage, he pursued his dreams as was mentioned and retired from acting to produce and write TV shows and films, including the short-lived but well-acclaimed _'American Gothic' (1995)_ (qv) as well as the other TV series _'The Agency' (2001)_ (qv) and _'Invasion' (2005)_ (qv). He also write the sequel to the hit motion picture _Midnight Run (1988)_ (qv) titled _Midnight Run for Your Life (1994) (TV)_ (qv), which became a noted TV movie. Writing and producing became Cassidy's most successful career in the industry today like for many other celebrities like former actor 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv). He admitted to this day he was only half good as a singer and admitted he had some limitations as an actor and felt he didn't enjoy it enough to pursue for the rest of his life.

He eventually returned to Florida where his parents (Jim Sr. and Cookie) are from and began his acting career on the stage at the tender age of 13 when he appeared in his first school play, 'A Thousand Clowns', at Seminole (Florida) High School. Jim accepted a football scholarship to Illinois State University as a theater major where he became involved with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company founded by 'Gary Sinise' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv). He put aside an acting career to play professional football, however, starting in 1981 with the Hamilton Tiger Cats in the CFL (Canadian Football league) followed by short stints with the Chicago Bears ('81) and the Baltimore Colts ('82). His football career ended when he retired in 1985, after spending three seasons with the Tampa Bay Bandits in the USFL ('83-'85). However, playing for the Bandits was a blessing in disguise. One of the owners of the Bandits was 'Burt Reynolds', who was instrumental in setting Jim's career in Los Angeles in motion. Jim began auditioning for productions during the off-seasons. Before moving to L.A., he landed parts in _'Miami Vice' (1984)_ (qv), _Cocoon (1985)_ (qv) and _D.A.R.Y.L. (1985)_ (qv). Since then, Jim has appeared in over 30 plays for the stage (six of which he has written, produced and directed in Los Angeles).

Smith, James Todd 14 January 1968 G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) LL Cool J (James Todd Smith), with Karen Hunter. _I Make My Own Rules._ New York: Ilion Books, 1997. ISBN 0-312-17110-2, L.L. Cool J was born James Todd Smith on January 14, 1968, in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, to James and Ondrea Smith. Todd, as he was called, did not have a very happy childhood. At the age of four, he saw his mother and grandfather shot by his own father. After they recovered from their injuries, his mother began to date a young physical therapist she met while in the hospital. The therapist treated Ondrea kindly, but for years he abused Todd physically and verbally, which resulted in Todd becoming a bully himself. It was during this period that he started wearing hats all the time (one of L.L. Cool J's trademarks is the fact that people never see him without a hat on--until recently). Fortunately, Ondrea finally discovered what this man was doing to her son and left him.  As he grew older, Todd found a way to escape the effects of his abuse and his bullying attitude: hip-hop music. He fell in love with it at the age of nine, and by 11 he was writing lyrics and making his own songs with some DJ equipment his grandfather gave him. At 15, he and one of his best friends came up with his present stage name, L.L. Cool J, which means 'Ladies Love Cool James.'  In 1984, when L.L. was 16, he met 'Rick Rubin' (qv), a student at NYU, who gave him his big break in music. Rick really liked L.L.'s music and decided to try to get him a record deal. Together, they made the single 'I Need a Beat' and sent it to an artist manager named 'Russell Simmons' (qv). Simmons loved the single, and, in the same year, Rick and Russell co-founded the famous Def Jam Recordings; L.L.'s debut album, 'Radio,' released in 1985, after securing a distribution deal for Def Jam with Columbia/CBS Records, was the label's first long-playing release. Even today, L.L. is considered one of Def Jam's most prized possessions.  1985 was also the year L.L. started his acting career. He first appeared in _Krush Groove (1985)_ (qv), which is a semi-biographical account of the early days of Def Jam Recordings. L.L. had a cameo appearance in the film. In 1986, L.L. also had a cameo appearance in the movie _Wildcats (1986)_ (qv) and also wrote that movie's theme song. After that, L.L. took a break from film and concentrated more on his first love: music. His career took off, and after every one of his albums hit platinum-selling status, he was (and still is) regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. After a few years, he had small roles in a few other films, but was still better known for his music.  All this changed in 1995. By this time he was a happily married 27-year-old with three children. His first starring film, _Out-of-Sync (1995)_ (qv), had also been released. It didn't do very well at the box office, but it got him noticed by executives at NBC-TV, who wanted to give him a part in a sitcom they were going to air. This sitcom was _'In the House' (1995)_ (qv), which showed L.L.'s acting ability; the show stayed on the air until 1999. He had been offered several films roles during the run of the show and decided to accept a part in _Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998)_ (qv). Its success resulted in L.L. being cast in bigger and better film roles, and he has acted alongside actors such stars 'Whoopi Goldberg' (qv), 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv), 'Jamie Lee Curtis' (qv), 'James Woods (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Omar Epps' (qv), 'Pam Grier' (qv), 'Stanley Tucci (I)' (qv), and 'Dennis Quaid' (qv), to name a few.  In 2000, he was finally rewarded for his acting talent. That year he won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for the best supporting actor in the action film _Deep Blue Sea (1999)_ (qv). Even though his film career has taken off, he hasn't forgotten his love of hip-hop music. In 1998, he was planning to retire from hip-hop and just concentrate on his film career, but he later decided to keep dividing his time between both fields. L.L. is not only known as one of the greatest MCs of all time, but he is also known as a great actor.

Their first gig was at a school dance and Levine was terribly shy so he played with his back to the audience. 'Ryan Dusick' (qv) joined the band as drummer and the alternative rock band Kara's Flowers were born (1994). They released an album called 'The Fourth World' (1997). Then, he headed to New York City with Carmichael to study music at Five Towns College on Long Island. While they were there, he was surrounded by new music scenes and influences which give him whole new perspective on songwriting and singing. He dropped out of school after a semester and headed back to California with Carmichael to reunite with their pals and develop their band. He began writing a bunch of songs that were inspired by his recently failed relationship. After adding in new guitarist 'James Valentine (IV)' (qv) (moving Carmichael over to keyboards) Maroon 5 was officially born.

ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

Album: 'In My Arms', 2001. Webb, Brenda Gail 9 January 1951 Born on January 9, 1951 in Paintsville, Kentucky, Crystal Gayle's family moved to Wabash, Indiana, when she was still quite young. Her music career was given a big boost by her older sister, country superstar 'Loretta Lynn' (qv). Loretta thought that Crystal's real name of Brenda Gail Webb was not quite 'classy' enough, and after noticing a sign for the Krystal restaurant chain, she changed the 'K' to a 'C' and her sister became Crystal Gayle. She recorded her first hit song, 'I've Cried the Blue (Right Out of My Eyes)', in 1970, which peaked at #23. In 1974, she signed up with United Artists Records and producer 'Allen Reynolds' (qv). Over the next two years, she released three albums and had several hit songs, including 'This Is My Year for Mexico', 'I'll Do It All Over Again', 'Wrong Road Again' and 'I'll Get Over You', her first #1. The next year, 1977, would prove to be a landmark year for Crystal with the release of her album 'We Must Believe in Magic' and the worldwide smash hit, 'Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue', which--along with her almost floor-length hair--made her a household name. She had many more hits throughout the rest of the 1970s, including 'Talking in Your Sleep', 'Ready for the Times to Get Better' and 'Half the Way'. She continued into the 1980s with such hits as 'If You Ever Change Your Mind', 'Too Many Lovers', 'The Woman in Me', 'Til I Gain Control Again' and 'The Sound of Goodbye'. In 1982, she recorded a duet with 'Eddie Rabbitt' (qv), the acclaimed 'You and I', which has become one of the most popular wedding songs ever. In 1985, she teamed up with 'Gary Morris (I)' (qv) to record the love theme for the prime-time soap opera _'Dallas' (1978)_ (qv), called 'Makin' Up For Lost Time', which turned into yet another #1 hit. Her other 1980s hits included 'A Long and Lasting Love', 'Nobody Wants to Be Alone', 'Straight to the Heart', 'Cry' and 'Nobody's Angel'. In 1987, she guest-starred on the daytime soap opera _'Another World' (1964)_ (qv) for a week. She teamed up again with Gary Morris and turned out the hit 'Another World', which was also used as the new theme song for the soap opera. Her career took somewhat of a downturn in the late 1980s and she released her last major single, 'Never Ending Song of Love', which peaked at #72, in 1990. Since then, she has released several more acclaimed albums and many hit compilations.

Garbutt Productions, 1979. Singer/songwriter Wanda Jean Jackson has enjoyed a long and successful music career which encompasses such diverse genres as country, gospel, and rockabilly. Wanda was born on October 20, 1937 in Maud, Oklahoma. Her father Tom was a former country singer who had to quit music because of the Depression. Jackson got her first guitar from her dad while living in California from 1941 to 1947. At age 12 Wanda and her family moved back to Oklahoma City. She won a local talent show contest in 1952 and got her own radio show on KLPR, which she hosted while attending high school. Jackson recorded several songs with the country group the Brazos Valley Boys in the 50's; her duet 'You Can't Have My Love' with band leader Billy Gray was a #8 country hit in 1954. Wanda met Elvis Presley while touring the country in 1956; Presley encouraged her to start recording rockabilly songs. Jackson's rousing 'Fujiyama Mama' was a huge smash in Japan; it remained at #1 on the charts for six weeks. The equally stirring 'Let's Have a Party' likewise did well; it peaked at #37 on the US pop charts in 1960. The touching ballads 'Right or Wrong' and 'In the Middle of a Heartache' were top 10 country hits in the early 60's. Wanda's other country hits include 'Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine,' 'Both Sides of the Line,' 'A Girl Don't Have to Drink to Have Fun,' 'A Woman Lives for Love,' and 'Fancy Satin Pillows.' In 1966 Jackson had a #1 hit in Germany with 'Santo Domingo,' which she sang entirely in German. In 1971 Wanda and her manager husband Wendell Goodman became borne-again Christians; Jackson subsequently has recorded several gospel albums and has performed gospel songs at churches. In 1995 Jackson sang two duets with alternative country singer Rosie Flores on Flores' album 'Rockabilly Filly.' She has been twice nominated for Grammy Awards and was awarded the Oklahoma Native Daughter Award. Moreover, Wanda has been inducted into the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the International Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, and the German Country Music Hall of Fame. Now in her early 70's, Wanda Jackson still continues to tour and perform all over the world.

Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D.

Video Game Crew Member Series Editor crew member director Alpha Barry  Steven Soderbergh   Alpha Barry 'Humo' (Belgium), 6 November 2001, Iss. 3192, pg. 128, 'De zwarte periode' 'Jules Asner' (qv) (10 May 2003 - present) At one point, was interested in directing _Fantastic Four (2005)_ (qv). [on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Fredric 'Fritz' Steinkamp 22 September 1936 'Mona Lindholm' (6 December 1964 - present); 1 child Ace cinematographer Owen Roizman was born September 22, 1936, in Brooklyn, New York. His father Sol was a cinematographer for Fox Movietone News and his uncle 'Morrie Roizman' (qv) was a film editor. Owen studied math and physics at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. He began his career shooting TV commercials, and made his feature debut as a director of photography with the obscure and little seen 1970 movie _Stop (1970)_ (qv). Owen brought a strong and compelling sense of raw, gritty, documentary-style realism to 'William Friedkin' (qv)'s harsh and hard-hitting police action thriller classic _The French Connection (1971)_ (qv). Roizman received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for his outstanding visual contributions to this picture; he went on to garner four additional Oscar nominations, for _The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv), _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), _Network (1976)_ (qv) and _Wyatt Earp (1994)_ (qv). Owen gave a similar rough and grainy look to the edgy urban thrillers _The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)_ (qv) and _Straight Time (1978)_ (qv). His other films encompass an impressively diverse array of different genres which include horror ('The Exorcist'), science fiction (_The Stepford Wives (1975)_ (qv)), comedy (_The Heartbreak Kid (1972)_ (qv) 'Tootsie'), musicals (_Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978)_ (qv)), drama (_True Confessions (1981)_ (qv), _Absence of Malice (1981)_ (qv)) and even Westerns (_The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976)_ (qv), 'Wyatt Earp').

In the future, I would like to be able to push a switch and have pot released into every household all over the world. (1975) Album: 'Red Headed Stranger' Nelson, Willie Hugh 30 April 1933 Red Headed Stranger (January 2006) Release of the book, 'Willie Nelson: The Outlaw' by Graeme Thomson. Willie Nelson, with Bud Shrake. _Willie._ Cooper Square Press, 2000. ISBN 0815410808 This versatile, eclectic, rather wanderlust country crossover star known for his classic ballads ('Always On My Mind'), autobiographical road songs ('On the Road Again') and catchy rhythms ('Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys') started out life as Willie Hugh Nelson on April 30, 1933, in Depression-era Abbot, Texas. After his mother abandoned the family and his father died, he and sister Bobbie Lee were raised by gospel-singing grandparents. Working in the cotton fields, Willie was handed his first guitar at age six and within a short time was writing woeful country songs and playing in polka bands. During his teenage years he played at high school dances and honky-tonks. He also worked for a local radio station and by graduation time he had become a DJ with his own radio show. Briefly serving a stint with the Air Force (discharged because of a bad back, which would plague him throughout his life), he sold his first song called 'No Place For Me' while getting by with menial jobs as a janitor and door-to-door Bible salesman. Married in 1952 to a full-blooded Cherokee, he and first wife Martha had two children. He initially came to be known in Nashville for selling his songs to well-established country artists such as 'Patsy Cline' (qv) ('Crazy'), 'Faron Young' (qv) ('Hello Walls') and 'Ray Price (III)' (qv) ('Night Life'). In 1962 he recorded a successful duet with singer Shirley Collie, whom he would later take as his second wife, but his career didn't progress despite joining the Grand 'Ol Opry. In the early 1970s, after extensive touring with his band (which included sister Bobbie on the piano) and experiencing a number of career downswings, he started performing and recording his own songs instead of selling them to others. Two of his albums, 'Shotgun Willie' and 'Phases and Stages', helped him gain some stature. In 1975 it all came together with the album 'Red-Headed Stranger', which would become the top-selling country music album in history and propel him into the country music stratosphere. His offbeat phrasing, distinctive nasal tones and leathery, bewhiskered hippie-styled looks set a new standard for 'outlaw' country music. Around 1978 Willie showed himself to be a loose and natural presence in front of the camera, thus launching a film career. He had roles in several movies, his first opposite 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) and 'Jane Fonda' (qv) in _The Electric Horseman (1979)_ (qv). His took to leading roles as a country music star in _Honeysuckle Rose (1980)_ (qv), which would include a number of his songs on the soundtrack. He played opposite 'James Caan (I)' (qv) and 'Tuesday Weld' (qv) in _Thief (1981)_ (qv) and a legendary outlaw in the western _Barbarosa (1982)_ (qv). In the movie _Red Headed Stranger (1986)_ (qv), which was adapted from his hit 1975 album, he played a preacher, and he teamed up with pal 'Kris Kristofferson (I)' (qv) as a pair of country singers in _Songwriter (1984)_ (qv). He and pal Kristofferson went on to form The Highwaymen with the late 'Johnny Cash (I)' (qv) and 'Waylon Jennings' (qv) and he successfully recorded and toured with the group for a number of years. They also teamed up to remake the classic western _Stagecoach (1939)_ (qv) as a TV movie (_Stagecoach (1986) (TV)_ (qv)). As a unique song stylist, the bearded, braided-haired, bandanna-wearing non-conformist took a number of non-country standards and made them his own, including 'Elvis Presley' (qv)'s 'You Were Always on My Mind' and 'Ray Charles (I)' (qv)' 'Georgia on My Mind.' He happily married fourth wife Ann-Marie in 1991 and has survived more hard times in recent years, including a $16.7-million debt to the IRS and the suicide of one of his sons, Billy. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, Nelson received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998.

Series Producer Cinematographer cinematographer Roy H. Wagner   Buddy Born in a very small community in the mid west Roy had no other contact to his dream of becoming a cinematographer than through the local theater and the Los Angeles phone directory. He would recall the names of cinematographers as they appeared on their films and call them blindly to talk with them about their work. Many of them were so suprised by this young man's ambition and interest that they took him under their wing, mentoring him. When he arrived in Los Angeles he spent every moment with them on their sets and homes learning as much about them and their work as he could. Because of this he was able to meet and befriend many of the greatest cinematographers in Hollywood. His key mentor was Harry Stradling Sr. Through him he developed friendships with Joseph Ruttenberg, George Folsey, James Wong Howe, Leon Shamroy, Frank Phillipd, Leonard South, and many many others. In the late 70s he began a life long process of interviewing cinematographers on video tape or film. A deep reverence for all that is old Hollywood remains a great part of his life and the memory of the behind the scene stories told him as a young man is an important basis for his life and work.

I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Performing on stage was just an extracurricular activity for him at the local St. Gertrude School though he won raves. 'He has always been an entertainer', says his friend Jim Powers, a former teacher at St. Gertrude who is now his personal manager. 'He was really a leader of the school'. After attending the University of Missouri for a year and winning the state golf championship, he applied for a golf scholarship to the University of Arizona in 1980. 'Fifty young guys all thought they were going to be 'Jack Nicklaus' (qv)', he says. He lost out. In frustration, he auditioned for the drama program and won a full scholarship. From that point on, golf took second place. 'I decided that I have much more control over what I do on stage', says Jack, 'than whether or not my golf ball goes out-of-bounds when it hits a tree'. The day after graduating in 1982, Wagner drove to Los Angeles, where he found work as a tour guide at Universal Studios while auditioning for parts.

Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

'Jean-Claude Van Damme' by Bey Logan (Titan Books). Action Heroes Series. Born on Oct 18 1960, Jean-Claude Van Damme is the son of Eugene Van Varenberg and Eliana Van Varenberg. 'The Muscles from Brussels' originally known as Jean-Claude Van Varenberg, started martial arts at the age of 11. His father Eugene Van Varenberg introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. Jean-Claude started with Shotokan Karate and later studied Kickboxing, Taekwon-Do, and Muay Thai. He won the European professional karate association's middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels.  He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. So in 1981 Van Damme left Hong Kong and moved to Los Angeles, where he was trying for 5 years. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to 'Chuck Norris' (qv) he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie _Missing in Action (1984)_ (qv), but it wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. Then in 1984 he got a role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie _No Retreat, No Surrender (1986)_ (qv).  Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in _Bloodsport (1988)_ (qv). But the movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.  His martial arts assets, highlighted by his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent's head during a leaping 360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like _Cyborg (1989)_ (qv), _Lionheart (1990)_ (qv), _Double Impact (1991)_ (qv) and _Universal Soldier (1992)_ (qv). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit _Timecop (1994)_ (qv). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce.  It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - _The Quest (1996)_ (qv), which he directed; _Maximum Risk (1996)_ (qv) and _Double Team (1997)_ (qv). The three films made less than $50 million combined.  In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife 'Gladys Portugues' (qv) and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his problems and made movies like _Replicant (2001)_ (qv), _Derailed (2002)_ (qv), and _In Hell (2003)_ (qv) which did averagely in box office terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in those movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in different action tones.

ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

ISBN 0817201122 The son of a steel worker from Beaver Falls, Pa., Joseph William Namath (Joe Willie) came from the rich football tradition that is in Pennsylvania. After starring for Paul 'Bear' Bryant's Alabama Crimson Tide teams in the 1960s, Namath was drafted both the National Football League's (NFL) St. Louis Cardinals and the rival American Football League's (AFL) New York Jets in 1965. Namath, known as a brash performer in college, signed with the Jets for a then-record $450,000 and gave the upstart, struggling AFL instant credibility in its war with the NFL. Although he didn't turn the Jets into instant winners, he did improve their fortunes his first three years in the league. Namath delivered on his promise as one of the most exciting players in the AFL, by becoming the first quarterback in history to pass for more than 4,000 yards. Namath was also popular off the field, especially with the ladies (which he indulged in happily) and was known for his love of the New York nightlife. Because of this, he was dubbed 'Broadway Joe' by the New York press. Namath gained his legend with not only his performance, but his mouth. After leading the Jets to the AFL championship over the Oakland Raiders, Namath, weary of all the press knocking him and his team and openly favoring the NFL champion Baltimore Colts, boldly lashed out and predicted victory for him and the Jets. He also showed his poise by talking his way out of a potentially explosive situation with Colts Defensive Tackle, Lou Michaels. Namath and a teammate were in a restaurant talking about how the Jets were a better team than the Colts, when Michaels (who was in earshot) challenged Namath. The cocky QB instead bought Michaels dinner, drinks and gave him a ride home. In the game that many felt made the Super Bowl the spectacle it is today, Namath and the Jets were nearly flawless in beating the 17-point favorite Colts, 16-7. Namath became a household name and gave the Jets and the AFL the respectability they were so desperate to have. Namath continued his all-star performances in New York, although he never again played in the Super Bowl. For several years, he was the entertainer of the NFL (the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970) and even dabbled in movies and television (including a memorable performance in pantyhose for a commercial). He was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in 1977, but his failing knees finally gave out and he retired at the end of the season. Namath was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 and, for a few years, was a member of ABC's _'NFL Monday Night Football' (1970)_ (qv) crew. Namath now lives in Florida.

Video Game Country Person country composer Michael Stearns    Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female

Her music career was given a big boost by her older sister, country superstar 'Loretta Lynn' (qv). Loretta thought that Crystal's real name of Brenda Gail Webb was not quite 'classy' enough, and after noticing a sign for the Krystal restaurant chain, she changed the 'K' to a 'C' and her sister became Crystal Gayle. She recorded her first hit song, 'I've Cried the Blue (Right Out of My Eyes)', in 1970, which peaked at #23. In 1974, she signed up with United Artists Records and producer 'Allen Reynolds' (qv). Over the next two years, she released three albums and had several hit songs, including 'This Is My Year for Mexico', 'I'll Do It All Over Again', 'Wrong Road Again' and 'I'll Get Over You', her first #1. The next year, 1977, would prove to be a landmark year for Crystal with the release of her album 'We Must Believe in Magic' and the worldwide smash hit, 'Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue', which--along with her almost floor-length hair--made her a household name. She had many more hits throughout the rest of the 1970s, including 'Talking in Your Sleep', 'Ready for the Times to Get Better' and 'Half the Way'. She continued into the 1980s with such hits as 'If You Ever Change Your Mind', 'Too Many Lovers', 'The Woman in Me', 'Til I Gain Control Again' and 'The Sound of Goodbye'. In 1982, she recorded a duet with 'Eddie Rabbitt' (qv), the acclaimed 'You and I', which has become one of the most popular wedding songs ever. In 1985, she teamed up with 'Gary Morris (I)' (qv) to record the love theme for the prime-time soap opera _'Dallas' (1978)_ (qv), called 'Makin' Up For Lost Time', which turned into yet another #1 hit. Her other 1980s hits included 'A Long and Lasting Love', 'Nobody Wants to Be Alone', 'Straight to the Heart', 'Cry' and 'Nobody's Angel'. In 1987, she guest-starred on the daytime soap opera _'Another World' (1964)_ (qv) for a week. She teamed up again with Gary Morris and turned out the hit 'Another World', which was also used as the new theme song for the soap opera.

ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

Video Game Series Production Designer Video Movie actor featured in  Paul Benjamin    1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

Marrow, Tracy Lauren 16 February 1958 Ice Ice-T and Douglas Century. _Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption-from South Central to Hollywood._ New York: One World/Ballantine, 2011. ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

Language TV Movie Actress actress language Kelly McGillis    'Parade Magazine' (USA), November 1997, pg. 22, by: James Brady, 'In Step With: Kelly McGillis' 'Boyd Black' (14 April 1979 - 1981) (divorced) Wanted to play the role of 'Kathryn Murphy', the district attorney in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv), because she and her roommate were assaulted and raped by two men in their apartment in 1982. 'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

Episode Editor Person production designer crew member Bill Blair Peter Jamison   Bill is now the Guinness World record holder in the category 'most special effect make-up characters portrayed in a career' the new record number set May 6, 2011 is 202.  Born and raised in Kent Ohio, Bill graduated Kent State University, in 1977 with a degree in Telecommunications. But during college, Bill realized that he wanted something else. He embarked on a music career, and in the early 1980's he toured, as the leader of a band called Expression. In 1982, after recovering from a serious injury, he moved to Chicago and shifted to a career in entertainment. His first bit-part in a movie came in 1982 in an American Playhouse film titled 'The Killing Floor'. By the following summer, Bill was landing featured bit-parts and stand-in work on several films. He got his first speaking role, in 1984, in the TV movie 'The Impostor'. In late 1984, Bill moved to Dallas. Over the next five years, he kept busy with print ads and industrial shows, and played his first alien character. He portrayed Mr. Spock in an industrial film at the Dallas Convention Center for the Oracle Software Company. In January of 1990, Bill relocated to Los Angeles, then quickly on to Florida in the fall of 1992 and took a job entertaining at the Busch Gardens water park called Adventure Land. In January 1993, Bill returned to Los Angeles. His first experience as an alien on television was in Alien Nation. It started when he met makeup designer Richard Snell, while filming Demolition Man. This led Bill to his first work on the TV movies of 'Alien Nation'. Since then, he has become one of those few elite actors that seem to specialize in playing aliens from other worlds and of this world long ago. It was from there, that he found himself working on the hit series Babylon 5 and shortly thereafter on the Star Trek:Deep Space Nine. Bill worked all five seasons of Babylon 5 plus two TV movies for TNT, and multiple seasons on DS9. In 1998, Bill worked on the season premiere episode of Sliders. Bill also worked with his friend Peter Jurasik on three 'Sliders' episodes in 1999. Since then, Bill has worked on many a TV series, including Star Trek: Voyager, Enterprise, The X-Files, The Invisible Man, Drew Carey, Family Law, The District, Crossing Jordan, Providence, King of Queens, Will and Grace, Yes, Dear!, Friends, Desperate Housewives, Criminal Minds, and as a regular on 'The Division' and the HBO Series Carnivale. More recently, Bill has appeared in Blades of Glory, Saving Grace, Justified, Raising Hope, iCarly, The Defenders, How I Met Your Mother, NCIS, and Mad Men. And in print, Bill was a featured zombie in the book 'The Brain Eater's Bible', released in 2011. As one of a special group of actors that has worked extensively on sci-fi, and fantasy/horror shows, Bill has many behind-the-scenes stories to share about what it took to become this extraordinary type of actor. Additionally, Bill has written a book titled 'The Professionals Talent Handbook: The Guide to Getting Started' and he has appeared on the pages of TV Guide (July 5, 1997), and in the August 1998 issue of Galactic Alliance. Interviews with Bill can be found in such publications as the International Star Trek Magazine, Explorer, Pen & Quill, Autograph Times, and TV Zone.

Video Game Series Production Designer Country actor production country  Paul Benjamin    1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

And I love that. It's just funny that it didn't do that well in theaters. It did all right, but none of us were big stars at the time. 'Jason Biggs (I)' (qv) was probably bigger than any of us. That's another one that kind of baffles me. So many people have seen it. I got this big Western coming out. I have another crazy comedy that I really like, _Strange Wilderness (2008)_ (qv). It's just fucking dumb, and I can't wait to see how people react, because I just know that I'll have people approach me and say 'Strange Wilderness, man. That's my favorite movie'. I'll love that.

Crew Member Series Production Designer crew member writer  Cathy Ragona Roger Avary birth notes gender other works aka name trade mark trivia birth name mini biography birth date article quotes Cathy Ragona Cathy Agcayab Ragona 23 August 1965 Having been overshadowed by former co-worker 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) during the early 1990s, film maker Roger Avary finally established himself with his 2002 adaptation of the 'Bret Easton Ellis' (qv) novel _The Rules of Attraction (2002)_ (qv). Avary was born on August 23, 1965 in Flin Flon, Manitoba, Canada, but grew up in Arizona in the United States. After briefly attending the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Avary drifted to nearby Manhattan Beach, California, and in the 1980s worked as a video store clerk. He became friends with fellow employee Tarantino. The pair often collaborated on stories. The stories eventually became screenplays, and the two often swapped material (which they might have later regretted). Around this time Avary wrote an 80-page script titled 'The Open Road.' Although never made it into a film, parts of this script were used for various bits and pieces that added up to classic scenes in future collaborations.  It was not until 1992 that their first film was released, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv), for which Avary did some background writing. Though initially panned by a some critics (most notably, 'Roger Ebert' (qv) and 'Gene Siskel' (qv)), the film resonated with audiences and won awards due to a level of artistically-penned nihilism not seen on the silver screen at the time. The amount of blood and violence defined Avary and Tarantino's early careers.  Meanwhile, _True Romance (1993)_ (qv), a film written by the pair and originally to be directed by Tarantino, was sold off in order to finance Reservoir Dogs. Unlike with the earlier film, True Romance had a larger portion of the film influenced by Avary's writing, but he was left uncredited by Tarantino. It was not the first - or last time - this happened. It was in 1994 that the pair really took of career-wise. Avary's directional debut, _Killing Zoe (1993)_ (qv), was released. Dark, sexual, and violent, it won several independent cinema awards. But the film was compared too often to the works of Tarantino (who co-produced it), mostly because it came out around the same time as the pair's most famous work, _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv). The stories in the film - about a boxer, two hitmen, and their boss' wife - earned the duo an Academy Award for best original screenplay and it won the Palm d'Or (best film) from the Cannes film festival.  After 1994, Avary and Tarantino went their separate ways artistically. They seldom discuss their divergence, though Avary hints that it has to do with how much creative juice they suck from each other. Even though he was now an Oscar winner, Avary spent the tail end of the decade doing mostly script rewrites and polishes. He received a chance to direct once again when Lions Gate Films bought the film rights to the Ellis novel, The Rules of Attraction. Being more faithful to the book than most adaptations, Avary was still able to insert his own style into the film that made critics take note of how different he could actually be from the grimmer Tarantino. The opening of the film even featured an in-joke about _Killing Zoe (1993)_ (qv) being 'wrongfully considered a 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) film.'  Since then, he has been putting some finishing touches on two film scripts for other directors while working on another adaptation for an Ellis book, Glamorama.

In addition to Pacino and Nora Ephron, Andr? has had the pleasure of working with Tom Hanks, Bob Zemekis, Taylor Hackford, Andrew Adamson, and Adam Sandler. Since moving to Los Angeles he has covered the gambit in the voice-acting field. As a voice-match artist Andr? has looped for the likes of Russel Crowe, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, and Clint Eastwood. His animated feature work includes the twin train engineers Smokey and Steamer in The Polar Express (2005), Lion King 1 &1/2 (2004), Mulan 2 (2004), and Disney's The Wild(2006).  With L.A.

(On the cult status of _Office Space (1999)_ (qv)) It was like a lot of movies. You do the movie and then you walk away. It lasted maybe five weeks in theaters, if that. The first time I got a sense of it was probably a year later. I was doing a play in Chicago in the summer of 2000, because here [in L.A.], you don't spend a lot of time on the street. You're always driving. But in Chicago, I lived next door to the theatre, so I was always walking up and down this big boulevard in Chicago, Halsted Street, and going to restaurants and just down the street a lot. And people started coming up to me, doing Lumbergh's dialogue. And this is a year and a half later, and I was really surprised, because I thought the movie was a flop. I didn't know that it had gained an audience on video. And it happened consistently. I started going to restaurants and people would be like, 'Hey Lumbergh!' I went to the ballpark at Wrigley Field, people were shouting out Lumbergh's name. I thought, 'My God, somebody's actually watching this thing'. So that's the first time, but then you kind of realize that in this day and age, a movie doesn't have to be successful in the theater, necessarily. I mean, it helps, but it doesn't have to die a death in the theater and never be seen again. You get a second chance if word of mouth helps you out, and that was the case of _Office Space (1999)_ (qv). (1984) Stage: Appeared in 'Tracers' at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, IL.

Video Game Series Producer Country country writer Ian Fleming     'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

The new CD and children's book are expected to be released in 2007. Connie Berman (foreword by Dolly Parton). _The Official Dolly Parton Scrapbook._ New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1978. ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

ISBN 978-0615443140 Multi-faceted, a consummate entertainer and a true song stylist, Stella has touched audiences worldwide not only through her music, but her stage, television and film presence as well.  Stella began her entertainment career at an early age singing gospel music with her family - in church and on television and radio. Her first two albums, which included several original compositions, reflected that early influence and delivered that same sincerity and honesty which is felt in her music today.  Relocating to Nashville, Stella wrote and recorded her first hit single, 'I Want To Hold You In My Dreams Tonight', which launched her career in country music. She since has recorded 27 chart singles, 17 albums and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including multiple ASCAP Awards and ACM and Music City News Award nominations.  Not one to feel fenced in by creative boundaries, Stella took on the rigors of the theatre, starring in four New York touring productions, including 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers', 'The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas', 'Pump Boys and Dinettes' and 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'. Stella has been featured in such films as _Cloud Dancer (1980)_ (qv), _The Loner (1988) (TV)_ (qv) and _Country Gold (1982) (TV)_ (qv).

A year later, the singer-actress had a solo in her kindergarten play, but to her mom's dismay, the mike had not been adjusted to suit her daughter's height. Without missing a beat, Palmer lowered the mike and moved the crowd with her heavenly voice. At that very moment, her family knew there was something special about Keke (a nickname given to her by her sister).  Although music was still her passion, Palmer's first big break came via her acting skills, making her big screen debut in _Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004)_ (qv) as 'Queen Latifah' (qv)'s niece. Immediately recognizing her star potential, the film's producers encouraged Palmer's parents to take their daughter to California to explore other acting opportunities. Relocating required that Palmer's parents leave behind the security of their jobs, a newly purchased home, and uproot their other three children. However, it didn't diminish the family's support of Palmer's aspirations.  Once settled on the West Coast, Palmer did not waste any time. Within six weeks, she had booked an episode of the critically acclaimed CBS Show _'Cold Case' (2003)_ (qv), booked a national K-Mart commercial, and was chosen from a nationwide search to play opposite 'William H. Macy' (qv) in a TNT movie. Palmer's performance in _The Wool Cap (2004) (TV)_ (qv) was so amazing that it earned her a Screen Actors Guild Nomination, to date, she is the youngest actress (then at age ten) ever to receive a nomination in a Lead Actress Category.  In 2006, Palmer appeared as the lead character Akeelah Anderson in the critically acclaimed, award-winning film _Akeelah and the Bee (2006)_ (qv). The film, about young South Los Angeles girl who attempts to win a national spelling bee, won the hearts of audiences everywhere. Keke held her own in scenes with acting veteran co-stars 'Angela Bassett' (qv) and 'Laurence Fishburne' (qv). That very same year, Palmer appeared in 'Tyler Perry (I)' (qv)'s _Madea's Family Reunion (2006)_ (qv), which was number #1 at the box office for two consecutive weeks!  Palmer went on to win a 2007 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her breakout role in _Akeelah and the Bee (2006)_ (qv). She also received a ShoWest Award for Rising Star of the Year. Shortly after, Palmer lit up the small screen starring in the Disney Channel's hit movie _Jump In! (2007) (TV)_ (qv). This one-two punch of big screen success coupled with small screen ratings power made Keke Palmer a household name in Hollywood.  Palmer contributed her first recording, which was featured on the 'Akeelah and the Bee' soundtrack, titled 'All My Girlz' and followed it up with the ever popular 'My Turn Now' on the 'Jump In' Movie soundtrack. As if two soundtracks were not enough, she was also asked to sing 'Tonight,' an end title song from the smash-hit 'Ben Stiller' (qv) movie _Night at the Museum (2006)_ (qv).  Her Atlantic Records debut album, titled 'So Uncool,' is jammed with up-tempo R&B tracks, inspirational moments, and love songs.  Look for her next in the feature film _Cleaner (2007)_ (qv), in which she co-stars with 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv), 'Eva Mendes' (qv), and 'Ed Harris (I)' (qv). Her single 'Footworkin'' hit stores in July 2007; her album 'So Uncool' hit stores September 2007.

I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Born in Toronto, Canada, Ted Kotcheff graduated with a degree in English Literature from the University of Toronto. He began his professional career directing TV drama at age 24 at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, at the time becoming the youngest director in the CBC. After two years there he went to live and work in England, directing in television and the theatre.  He twice won the British Emmy for Best Director, the second time for an extraordinary docudrama about a female derelict entitled, 'Edna, the Inebriate Woman' episode of _'Play for Today' (1970)_ (qv). The film also won the Best Actress and Best Script Award. Kotcheff's television work in Great Britain was part of the new wave of working-class actors and drama that changed British theatre and television in the late 1950s. His stage successes include the long-running 'Lionel Bart' (qv) musical, 'Maggie May.' His film career started in England: _Tiara Tahiti (1962)_ (qv), a social comedy starring 'James Mason (I)' (qv) and 'John Mills (I)' (qv); _Life at the Top (1965)_ (qv), starring 'Laurence Harvey (I)' (qv) and 'Jean Simmons (I)' (qv); _Two Gentlemen Sharing (1969)_ (qv), starring 'Robin Phillips (I)' (qv), a film set in the West Indian community of London and dealing with relationships between blacks and whites which was the official British entry at the Venice Film Festival. His next film, _Wake in Fright (1971)_ (qv), was made in Australia. It was the Australian entry in the Cannes Film Festival and many Australians still think it is the finest Australian film ever made and the beginning of the renaissance of the Australian cinema. Kotcheff returned to Canada in 1972 to make a film of a novel written by his best friend, 'Mordecai Richler' (qv), _The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974)_ (qv). This film, thought to be one of the best Canadian films ever made, won the Golden Bear First Prize at the Berlin Film Festival and numerous other awards including an Academy Award nomination for best script. Kotcheff also directed _Fun with Dick and Jane (1977)_ (qv), starring 'Jane Fonda' (qv) and 'George Segal (I)' (qv); _Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?

In the mid-'80s Kotcheff made a film of another Mordecai Richler novel, _Joshua Then and Now (1985)_ (qv). This film, starring 'James Woods (I)' (qv) and 'Alan Arkin' (qv), was the official Canadian entry in the Cannes Film Festival, and together with 'The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz', is one of the most widely known and acclaimed Canadian films in the United States. Kotcheff is married to Laifun Chung and has two children, Thomas age 7 and Alexandra age 9. Laifun Chung is President of their film company, Panoptica Productions, Inc.

Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

Romero' (qv) (6 October 2006 - present) Martin Campbell knows how to entertain an audience when he steps behind the camera. When he directed _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv), the movie earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations and launched the international careers of 'Antonio Banderas' (qv) and 'Catherine Zeta-Jones' (qv). Next, when he helmed _Vertical Limit (2000)_ (qv), the film was well received by the critics and earned over $200 million in worldwide box-office sales. In addition, Campbell is credited with rejuvenating the James Bond franchise when he directed _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv), 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv)'s first outing as the famed British spy, which went on to gross more than $350 million. He directed the next Bond feature as well, _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv).  Born in New Zealand, Campbell moved to London where he began his career as a cameraman. He went on to produce the controversial British feature _Scum (1979)_ (qv), as well as _Black Joy (1977)_ (qv), which was selected for competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Campbell made his directorial debut on the British police action series _'The Professionals' (1977)_ (qv) and continued with the popular BBC series _'Shoestring' (1979)_ (qv) and Thames TV's _'Minder' (1979)_ (qv)  Considered one of the U.K.'s top directors by the mid-'80s, he directed the highly praised British telefilm, _'Reilly: Ace of Spies' (1983)_ (qv). For his work on _'Edge of Darkness' (1985)_ (qv), a five-hour BBC miniseries about nuclear contamination in England that depicted murder and high-ranking corruption, he won six BAFTA awards.  Campbell's first Hollywood movie was _Criminal Law (1998)_ (qv) and he went on to direct _Defenseless (1991)_ (qv) and _No Escape (1994)_ (qv). Some of his American credits include directing HBO's _Cast a Deadly Spell (1991) (TV)_ (qv) and two episodes of NBC's _'Homicide: Life on the Street' (1993)_ (qv), among others. He also directed the epic romance _Beyond Borders (2003)_ (qv) starring 'Angelina Jolie' (qv) and 'Clive Owen (I)' (qv). Martin Campbell 'Gold Series' (Greece), March 2006, pg. 18,19, 'Infos' Directed two James Bond actors in their respective debuts: 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) and 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv). Campbell had cameo appearances in both films. Frequently sets important portions of the film or has characters fighting one another atop very high places. I like pre-production and post the best. I don't like shooting at all. I find it grueling and tough, but I love post and the whole process of seeing the film finally come together. You start ironing out all the rough spots, and the really bad bits you just throw away. So from day one of post to the last day, you see nothing but improvements. Hastings, New Zealand Male

Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female

His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv). Brad Fiedel His most famous piece is the _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) theme tune.

And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent.

(1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Video Game Producer TV Movie Genre genre writer  Ian Fleming    'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

Video Game Episode Production Designer Actress actor crew member Alpha Barry Paul Benjamin    Alpha Barry 1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

Marrow, Tracy Lauren 16 February 1958 Ice Ice-T and Douglas Century. _Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption-from South Central to Hollywood._ New York: One World/Ballantine, 2011. ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.

Moments in a wide-release picture known as 'The Hollywood Moment'. We have no obligation to make history. We have no obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. Our obligation is to make money. Simpson, Donald Clarence 29 October 1943 'High Concept: Don Simpson and The Hollywood Culture Of Excess' by Charles Fleming (Doubleday, 1998) Don Simpson, one of the most highly regarded creative forces in the entertainment industry and one of the most successful producers of all time, was a filmmaker who loved movies. In the 1980s, he was responsible for some of entertainment's most popular and enduring motion pictures. In the 1990s, this exceptional and unique producer continued that tradition, bringing audiences worldwide films that thrill, excite and delight. His tremendous contributions to the entertainment industry are dearly missed and there will always be an empty seat at the theatre.  A look back at the films that begin with the dual lightning bolt. With worldwide revenues of over $10 billion in box office, video and recording receipts, Simpson earned not only the acclaim and respect of the entertainment industry but the devotion of moviegoers worldwide.  Simpson was a native of Anchorage, Alaska, and spent several years as a senior executive at Paramount Pictures before becoming President of Worldwide Production at Paramount. As president, Simpson was instrumental in the making of such films as _American Gigolo (1980)_ (qv), _Urban Cowboy (1980)_ (qv), _Little Darlings (1980)_ (qv), _An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)_ (qv) and _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv). The years at Paramount fueled Simpson's creativity, provided him with invaluable experience and inspired him to take on his own projects. The first was the 1983 smash hit _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv), which grossed $100 million in the U.S. alone and made an instant star of 'Jennifer Beals' (qv). It also paired Simpson with an old acquaintance, 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who would be his partner for the next 14 years.  One of the most prolific partnerships in motion picture history, Simpson and Bruckheimer produced films that were honored with 15 Academy Award nominations, two Oscars for Best Song, four Grammys, three Golden Globes, two People's Choice Awards for Best Picture, and the MTV award for Best Picture of the Decade. Equally important to Simpson, creatively, was the fact that the films were turning the stars into box office giants. _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) launched 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv)'s career and _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) made 'Tom Cruise' (qv) an international superstar.  Industry acclaim followed the box office success. In both 1985 and 1988, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) named Simpson Producer of the Year. And in 1988, along with his partner, Simpson was chosen as the Motion Picture Showman of the Year by the Publicists Guild of America.  Simpson and Bruckheimer were one of the most distinguished producing teams in motion picture history. Throughout the Eighties, they connected with such smash hits as _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Beals' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv), _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)_ (qv) with 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) and _Days of Thunder (1990)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv) as 'Cole Trickle'.  By 1995, the team was producing one hit after another. In that year alone, Simpson was responsible for _Bad Boys (1995)_ (qv), the 'Will Smith (I)' (qv)/'Martin Lawrence (I)' (qv) film that was Columbia Pictures' highest grossing movie of the year; 'Michelle Pfeiffer' (qv)'s acclaimed _Dangerous Minds (1995)_ (qv); and _Crimson Tide (1995)_ (qv), the 'Denzel Washington' (qv)/'Gene Hackman' (qv) adventure thriller.  In 1996, Simpson produced _The Rock (1996)_ (qv) starring 'Sean Connery' (qv) and 'Nicolas Cage' (qv). The film brought in nearly $350 million worldwide at the box office, and set the video rental market record as the most-ordered film in history. _The Rock (1996)_ (qv), named Favorite Movie of the Year by the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), was Simpson's last movie.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health.

To this end he has written several scripts in various genres and has written and directed two short sci-fi films Indigo and Thanatos.

But even as a kid, after seeing him lift a planet one issue, race around the world in a half a second the next, then get beat by the Toy Man the issue after that, I decided his powers were too magical, inconsistent and almost childish even for comic books. So I graduated to Marvel. They were for older kids and adults anyway.

Production Designer TV Movie Actor actor production designer Wynn Thomas Paul Benjamin   Wynn Thomas Wyn Thomas 1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

Video Game Series Director Genre composer genre  Michael Stearns    Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female

He began playing guitar at the age of 12 after having had piano lessons since he was a toddler. In 1972 he formed the band Rabbit becoming the most successful rock act ever to emerge from South Africa. Rabin left Rabbit to pursue a solo career in London and released three solo albums.  Rabin moved to Los Angeles in 1982. Here he became a member of the newly reformed progressive art/rock group Yes for the groundbreaking 90125 album as a guitarist, keyboardist, singer, songwriter, producer and recording engineer. He penned the majority of the songs on 90125 as well as Big Generator and Talk, before leaving Yes in 1994 to pursue a career as a film composer.  Rabin has scored three dozen films which include Con Air, Homegrown, Armageddon, Enemy of the State, Jack Frost, Deep Blue Sea, Gone in 60 Seconds, Remember the Titans, The 6th Day, The Banger Sisters, Kangaroo Jack, Bad Boys 2, The Great Raid, Exorcist: The Beginning, National Treasure, Coach Carter, Snakes On A Plane, The Guardian, and Flyboys.  Along with many Grammy nominations and one win, Mr. Rabin also has received nine BMI film score awards, and has received a lifetime achievement award from the Temecula Film Festival.

Video Game Series Director Genre composer genre  Brad Fiedel    10 March 1951 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv) (? - present) Extremely talented, prolific and versatile composer Brad Fiedel was born on March 10, 1951 in New York City. His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv).

ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

Video Game Series Production Designer Language actor language  Paul Benjamin    1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

(1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win.

(1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Jr., George Walton Lucas 14 May 1944 John Baxter. _Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas._ New York: Spike/ Avon Books, 1999. George Walton Lucas, Jr. was raised on a walnut ranch in Modesto, California. His father was a stationery store owner and he had three siblings. During his late teens, he went to Downey High School and was very much interested in drag car racing. He planned to become a professional racecar driver. However, a terrible car accident just after his high school graduation ended that dream permanently. The accident changed his views on life. He decided to attend Modesto Junior College before enrolling in the University of Southern California film school. As a film student, he made several short films including THX-1138: 4EB (Electronic Labyinth) which won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival. In 1967, he was awarded a scholarship by Warner Brothers to observe the making of _Finian's Rainbow (1968)_ (qv) which was being directed by 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv). Lucas and Coppola became good friends and formed a company called American Zoetrope in 1969. The company's first project was Lucas' full-length version of _THX 1138 (1971)_ (qv). In 1971, Coppola went into production for _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv), and Lucas formed his own company, Lucasfilm Ltd. In 1973, he wrote and directed the semi-autobiographical _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) which won the Golden Globe and garnered five Academy Award nominations. This gave him the clout he needed for his next daring venture. From 1973 to 1974, he began writing the screenplay for _Star Wars (1977)_ (qv). He was inspired to make this movie from Flash Gordon and the Planet of the Apes films. In 1975, he established ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) to produce the visual effects needed for the movie. Another company called Sprocket Systems was established to edit and mix Star Wars and later becomes known as Skywalker Sound. His movie was turned down by several studios until 20th Century Fox gave him a chance. Lucas agreed to forgo his directing salary in exchange for 40% of the film's box-office take and all merchandising rights. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned seven Academy Awards. It redefined the term 'blockbuster'. The rest is history. Lucas made the other Star Wars films and along with 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) created the Indiana Jones series which made box office records of their own. From 1980 to 1985, Lucas was busy with the construction of Skywalker Ranch, built to accommodate the creative, technical, and administrative needs of Lucasfilm. Lucas also revolutionized movie theaters with the THX System which was created to maintain the highest quality standards in motion picture viewing. He went on to make several more movies that have created major breakthroughs in filmmaking. He is chairman of the board of The George Lucas Educational Foundation. In 1992, George Lucas was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his lifetime achievement.

I said, 'If I have a stroke on a plane, I hope the pretend doctor isn't the one on the plane. I want a real doctor.' Edwards, Anthony Charles 19 July 1962 ACE Born to a well-blended family, Anthony Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, on July 19, 1962, the youngest of five children. Growing up as the son of an architect and an artist, his parents encouraged him to act at age 16, which eventually led him to attending a summer workshop in London before graduating from high school. Returning to the United States, Edwards worked in commercials, jobs that helped him pay his education at The University of Southern California, where he studied acting. However, he dropped out of college and, in that same year, he had a small role in the movie _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv), starring 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv). The movie was a box office smash and Edwards was looking forward to doing more films. His first movie role was that of teen-aged 'John Muldowney' in _Heart Like a Wheel (1983)_ (qv) and his first starring role as nerdy 'Gilbert Lowell', in _Revenge of the Nerds (1984)_ (qv).  Edwards didn't need to worry about being typecast as a socially-challenged loser. After starring in _The Sure Thing (1985)_ (qv) and _Gotcha! (1985)_ (qv), he landed another big-time successful movie _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv), in which he played 'Tom Cruise' (qv)'s ill-fated easy-going navigator/best friend, Lt. Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw. As Cruise rode _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) into the Hollywood stratosphere, Edwards also found his flight to stardom, at the same time. After _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv), he reprised his role as Gilbert in the movie _Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987)_ (qv), before he starred in _Summer Heat (1987)_ (qv). He also starred in _Mr. North (1988)_ (qv), and _Miracle Mile (1988)_ (qv), although they weren't too successful.  Edwards began working in TV movies and continued to star in more box office movies such as _Hawks (1988)_ (qv), _How I Got Into College (1989)_ (qv), _Downtown (1990)_ (qv), _Pet Sematary II (1992)_ (qv), _Landslide (1992)_ (qv) and _Delta Heat (1992)_ (qv). The '90s won Edwards his best reviews for his recurring role of the quirky 'bubble man' Mike Monroe on the popular television series _'Northern Exposure' (1990)_ (qv). He was nominated for a Cable Ace Award in HBO's _Sexual Healing (1993)_ (qv), and the following year, he starred in _Charlie's Ghost Story (1995)_ (qv), before he played law clerk 'Clint Von Hooser' in the 'John Grisham' (qv) movie _The Client (1994)_ (qv). This led to his most prominent role, as easy-going charismatic physician 'Dr. Mark Greene' on the very popular TV series _'ER' (1994)_ (qv).  For his work on _'ER' (1994)_ (qv), he was nominated for an Emmy Award four times For Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, but has never won. However, he has won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-in-a-TV-Series, and was nominated four times, and also has two Screen Actor's Guild Awards. Prior to playing Dr. Greene, he also played bank breaker turned cold-blooded killer, 'Dick Hickock' in the TV movie remake of 'Truman Capote' (qv)'s _In Cold Blood (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which was the best TV movie of the 1996-97 season. During Edwards' hiatus on _'ER' (1994)_ (qv), he went back to the box office circuit to star and to produce the movie _Don't Go Breaking My Heart (1999)_ (qv), a complex movie which wasn't a big hit. Edwards, once again, returned to the set of _'ER' (1994)_ (qv), and this time, he signed up for a salary that almost no actor could be paid, so his decision was to stay on the show for 3 more years and possibly to save the money in order to spend a lot of family time and to work on directing later.  His first big roles after _'ER' (1994)_ (qv) were that of 'Brains' in the movie _Thunderbirds (2004)_ (qv), and as 'Jim Paretta' in _The Forgotten (2004)_ (qv). In the many years that he starred on _'ER' (1994)_ (qv), that show gave him more success in working on and off the set. Also, it gave him a spiritual blessing that so many popular actors have had over the years.

His musical career includes 12 TV specials. launching a solo career that produced 20 top-40 hits from 1968 through _Kenny Rogers: The Journey (2006) (V)_ (qv) Rogers, Kenneth Donald 21 August 1938 Kenny Rogers. _Luck or Something Like It - A Memoir._ New York: William Morrow, 2012. ISBN 0062071815 Born in Texas, the fourth of eight children, singer Kenny Rogers grew up in a poor area of Houston where his father worked in a shipyard and his mother in a hospital. He became the first member of his family to graduate from high school. He took an interest in singing while quite young and as a teenager joined a doo-wop recording group who called themselves 'The Scholars'. At age 19, Kenny recorded 'That Crazy Feeling' for a small Houston label, Carlton Records, and his career was off and running. Kenny joined the 'New Christy Minstrels' in the mid-1960s, then splintered off with others in the popular group to form 'The First Edition'. Their first big soft-rock hit, 'Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town' hit #6 on the US charts, while later successes included 'Something's Burning', 'Just Dropped In', 'Tell It All Brother' and 'Reuben James'. The husky-framed singer's ingratiating personality and sensual gravel tones soon took center stage and the group eventually renamed themselves 'Kenny Rogers and the First Edition'. They hosted a syndicated TV variety series from 1971 to 1973 called _'Rollin' on the River' (1971)_ (qv) but the pressures of taping a weekly show caused extreme friction within the group and eventually took its toll. After a couple of years of producing non-hit songs, the group disbanded in the mid-70s. Solo stardom seemed to be inevitable for Kenny and he began chalking up a string of country-tinged 'top 20' pop hits with 'Lucille' (#5), 'Don't Fall in Love With a Dreamer' (#4, with 'Kim Carnes' (qv)), 'Through the Years' (#13), 'We've Got Tonight' (#6, with 'Sheena Easton' (qv)) and his two #1 hit sellers 'Islands in the Stream' (with 'Dolly Parton' (qv)) and 'Lady'. By the late 1970s, he had sold over $100 million worth of records. The 1980s would tell a different story. Normally considered an easygoing talent, he was unflatteringly dubbed the 'overweight lightweight' by Rolling Stone Magazine, and the silvery-maned Kenny soon experienced a major slump. After charting lower and lower, he wisely branched off into other successful areas. In 1980, he touched off a modest, but appealing acting career with the TV-movie _Kenny Rogers as The Gambler (1980) (TV)_ (qv), based on his 1979 song hit. This led to four equally popular sequels. He also became a perennial star or co-star of TV seasonal specials. In addition, he published several books on photography and opened a rotisserie-chicken fast-food franchise. Less and less visible in the ensuing years, Kenny produced the 1999 album 'She Rides Wild Horses', which peaked at #6 on the country charts, his highest in 15 years, and included the #1 single 'Buy Me a Rose'. Spending a lot of time breeding Arabian horses and cattle on a 1,200-acre Georgia farm, Kenny's seems settled with his fifth wife Wanda Miller, who he married in 1997. One of his sons, 'Kenny Rogers Jr.' (qv), once followed in his father's boot steps, briefly launching his own singing career in 1989 with 'Take Another Step Closer'. He now is on the business end of entertainment providing music for TV and movies. Kenny's other two children are Carole and Christopher.

John De Cuir Jr. Los Angeles, California, USA Had a talent for deciphering key on-screen moments in a script. Moments in a wide-release picture known as 'The Hollywood Moment'. We have no obligation to make history. We have no obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. Our obligation is to make money. Simpson, Donald Clarence 29 October 1943 'High Concept: Don Simpson and The Hollywood Culture Of Excess' by Charles Fleming (Doubleday, 1998) Don Simpson, one of the most highly regarded creative forces in the entertainment industry and one of the most successful producers of all time, was a filmmaker who loved movies. In the 1980s, he was responsible for some of entertainment's most popular and enduring motion pictures. In the 1990s, this exceptional and unique producer continued that tradition, bringing audiences worldwide films that thrill, excite and delight. His tremendous contributions to the entertainment industry are dearly missed and there will always be an empty seat at the theatre.  A look back at the films that begin with the dual lightning bolt. With worldwide revenues of over $10 billion in box office, video and recording receipts, Simpson earned not only the acclaim and respect of the entertainment industry but the devotion of moviegoers worldwide.  Simpson was a native of Anchorage, Alaska, and spent several years as a senior executive at Paramount Pictures before becoming President of Worldwide Production at Paramount. As president, Simpson was instrumental in the making of such films as _American Gigolo (1980)_ (qv), _Urban Cowboy (1980)_ (qv), _Little Darlings (1980)_ (qv), _An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)_ (qv) and _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv). The years at Paramount fueled Simpson's creativity, provided him with invaluable experience and inspired him to take on his own projects. The first was the 1983 smash hit _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv), which grossed $100 million in the U.S. alone and made an instant star of 'Jennifer Beals' (qv). It also paired Simpson with an old acquaintance, 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who would be his partner for the next 14 years.  One of the most prolific partnerships in motion picture history, Simpson and Bruckheimer produced films that were honored with 15 Academy Award nominations, two Oscars for Best Song, four Grammys, three Golden Globes, two People's Choice Awards for Best Picture, and the MTV award for Best Picture of the Decade. Equally important to Simpson, creatively, was the fact that the films were turning the stars into box office giants. _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) launched 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv)'s career and _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) made 'Tom Cruise' (qv) an international superstar.  Industry acclaim followed the box office success. In both 1985 and 1988, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) named Simpson Producer of the Year. And in 1988, along with his partner, Simpson was chosen as the Motion Picture Showman of the Year by the Publicists Guild of America.  Simpson and Bruckheimer were one of the most distinguished producing teams in motion picture history. Throughout the Eighties, they connected with such smash hits as _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Beals' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv), _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)_ (qv) with 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) and _Days of Thunder (1990)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv) as 'Cole Trickle'.  By 1995, the team was producing one hit after another. In that year alone, Simpson was responsible for _Bad Boys (1995)_ (qv), the 'Will Smith (I)' (qv)/'Martin Lawrence (I)' (qv) film that was Columbia Pictures' highest grossing movie of the year; 'Michelle Pfeiffer' (qv)'s acclaimed _Dangerous Minds (1995)_ (qv); and _Crimson Tide (1995)_ (qv), the 'Denzel Washington' (qv)/'Gene Hackman' (qv) adventure thriller.  In 1996, Simpson produced _The Rock (1996)_ (qv) starring 'Sean Connery' (qv) and 'Nicolas Cage' (qv). The film brought in nearly $350 million worldwide at the box office, and set the video rental market record as the most-ordered film in history. _The Rock (1996)_ (qv), named Favorite Movie of the Year by the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), was Simpson's last movie.

Series Production Designer Character null actress Shelley Morrison    26 October 1936 'Walter Dominguez (I)' (qv) (1973 - present) Despite remaining on the periphery of character stardom all these years, New York-born character actress Shelley Morrison has had a long and varied career since the early 60s. She started out on TV in such popular shows as _'The Farmer's Daughter' (1963)_ (qv) and _'Laredo' (1965)_ (qv), making a career out of an assortment of ethnic roles. In films she played Indian squaws in _Three Guns for Texas (1968)_ (qv) and _Mackenna's Gold (1969)_ (qv), as well as minor Hispanic roles in _Castle of Evil (1966)_ (qv), _Man and Boy (1971)_ (qv) and _Troop Beverly Hills (1989)_ (qv). While most people remember her with fondness as the adorably shy but spirited 'Sister Sixto' who had problems mastering English (Shelley did in real life as well, as Spanish is her native language) in _'The Flying Nun' (1967)_ (qv) starring 'Sally Field' (qv), today's audiences have been relishing her turnabout performance as the vinegary El Salvadorean housekeeper, 'Rosario', the only character who doesn't mince words with 'Megan Mullally' (qv)'s socialite boss in another sitcom _'Will & Grace' (1998)_ (qv). Shelley's acting roots are firmly entrenched in the theatre, having performed, produced and directed hosts of plays over the years in Los Angeles, New York and abroad. Dampening the enjoyment of her renewed TV success, however, has been recent battles with cancer which is now in remission. Shelley Morrison 'L.A. County Sheriff's Dept.'

ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'.

Her first taste of the theater was early grade school and continued right through high school where she wrote, directed, and performed in dozens of plays. It was while she was at Central Jr. High that she organized the school's first Drama Club, which continues to thrive today. At Ball State University, prior to entering law school, the vivacious Ms. Harter dove headfirst into the school's theater and dance program performing in a number of dramatic and musical productions which eventually led to an audition on Broadway. Several Off-Broadway performances followed, including 'The French Lieutenant's Woman,' 'Inherit The Wind,' and 'Little Me.'

Ms. Harter has since appeared in guest roles as an attorney in various episodic shows such as 'Monk,' 'Out of Practice,' and 'Smith.'

Video Game Production Designer Producer TV Movie actor writer Ian Fleming  David Leitch   'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

I don't even think of _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) as a horror movie. The horrible thing is that people like this really exist. Radio interview for the film _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) with 'William Lustig' (qv) & 'Caroline Munro' (qv). _The Joe Spinell Story (2001) (V)_ (qv) Spagnuolo, Joseph J. 28 October 1936 Joseph J. Spagnuolo was born on October 28, 1936 in Manhattan, New York City at his family's apartment on 2nd Avenue. Spinell was a tough guy on and off screen all his life. During his teen years, while still in high school, he acted in various plays on the New York stage, on and off Broadway, eventually earning a place in Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival Theater. In 1960, he parlayed his stage work into a performing contract for MGM where it was suggested that he change his name to Joe Spinell to make his name easier to pronounce. For nine years, Spinell worked with the group, which was also known as the Theater of the Forgotten, which also put on plays in prisons for the inmates. His minimal salary for his stage work forced him to hold down other jobs to make ends meet. Those jobs included working as a taxi driver, a post office clerk, and a liquor store clerk during Christmas holidays.  In 1972, Spinell was first noticed when he appeared in his first movie role which was a small, uncredited speaking part in The Godfather (1972), the right film for a tough, mean-looking Italian with a New York City accent. After his success, he became a familiar character actor that appeared in violent urban movies where he was usually cast as vicious thugs or seedy gang leaders. In both Godfather movies he was the hit man Willy Cici. In Rocky (1976), the first of several films he made with Sylvester Stallone, he was the loan shark Gazzo who employs Rocky as a collector.  His best (or worst) or most disgusting role is probably the one where is his best remembered; in a rare starring role, his character of Frank Zito in Maniac (1980) is a serial killer that kills women and uses their scalps to dress up female mannequins he keeps in his apartment. After Maniac (1980), Spinell continued acting with big-name Hollywood and independent movie directors usually playing villainous thugs in small to medium roles.  During the last years of his life Spinell's choice of projects becomes increasingly suspect; for example imprisoned serial killer John Wayne Gacy wanted Spinell to play him in a movie. But with Maniac (1980) still on his mind, Spinell always wanted to do a sequel to the movie and with New York filmmaker Buddy Giovinazzo, they shot a 10-minute promo reel in 1986 titled Mr. Robbie, which was to be the sequel for Maniac (1980). After a few years of hard work and searching, Spinell found financing for the sequel. But just as pre-production was to begin, Joe Spinell suddenly passed away in his apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, New York on January 13, 1989, at age 52 due to undetermined causes, still the subject of much speculation. Some say he died of a heart attack because of his failing health in recent months due to his heavy drinking, drug use, and the emotional turmoil resulting from his mother's death (who passed away in 1987.) Others say he died from an asthma attack, or that he bled to death from an accidental (or deliberate) cut since he was a hemophiliac.  Spinnel left behind an impressive body of film work that stands as a testament to his talent and unique screen presence as a character actor. He is survived by an ex-wife, a daughter, two brothers and a sister.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Production Designer Language TV Movie production designer language   Boris Leven birth notes death date aka name mini biography birth date death notes 13 August 1908 Boris Leven was born in Moscow, where he first studied painting and design. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1927 and attended the University of Southern California, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture in 1932. He went on to complete his education at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York and, the following year, was signed by Paramount to work as a sketch artist and illustrator under the tutelage of the experienced art director 'Hans Dreier' (qv). After a three-year apprenticeship, Leven went on to work for independent producer 'Samuel Goldwyn' (qv). His big break came in 1937, when he was signed under contract at 20th Century Fox as fully-qualified art director and production designer. For his first major assignment, _Alexander's Ragtime Band (1938)_ (qv), he utilised more than 85 period sets. Proficient not only with historical detail, but also instinctive about the mood or thematic requirement of a picture, he brought imagination to the look of _The Shanghai Gesture (1941)_ (qv), _Tales of Manhattan (1942)_ (qv) and varied other assignments.  Leven remained at Fox until 1947, then joined Universal (1947-48), free-lanced, had another spell with Fox (1951-52), then worked for United Artists (1953) and Warner Brothers (1954-55). In-between, he worked privately on oil and watercolour paintings, some of which found their way into private collections, or were exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Leven became best known in the 1950's for his work on the production design of _Giant (1956)_ (qv), for which he set the scene with the indelible image of an opulent Victorian mansion, contrasting like a monolith against the broad expanse of harsh Texan prairie - providing allegorical imagery of copious human materialism vis-?-vis raw nature. In 1962, Leven won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction and Set Decoration for _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), a mixture of deliberately stylised theatrically-based sets and realistic New York locations. His other notable films during this period were _The Sound of Music (1965)_ (qv) and _The Sand Pebbles (1966)_ (qv), his work being greatly facilitated by picturesque on-location shooting, respectively, in the Austrian Alps and Salzburg, and in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

Series Producer Language language cinematographer Roy H. Wagner    Buddy Born in a very small community in the mid west Roy had no other contact to his dream of becoming a cinematographer than through the local theater and the Los Angeles phone directory. He would recall the names of cinematographers as they appeared on their films and call them blindly to talk with them about their work. Many of them were so suprised by this young man's ambition and interest that they took him under their wing, mentoring him. When he arrived in Los Angeles he spent every moment with them on their sets and homes learning as much about them and their work as he could. Because of this he was able to meet and befriend many of the greatest cinematographers in Hollywood. His key mentor was Harry Stradling Sr. Through him he developed friendships with Joseph Ruttenberg, George Folsey, James Wong Howe, Leon Shamroy, Frank Phillipd, Leonard South, and many many others. In the late 70s he began a life long process of interviewing cinematographers on video tape or film. A deep reverence for all that is old Hollywood remains a great part of his life and the memory of the behind the scene stories told him as a young man is an important basis for his life and work.

Richard S. Bruno 13 August 1908 Boris Leven was born in Moscow, where he first studied painting and design. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1927 and attended the University of Southern California, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture in 1932. He went on to complete his education at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York and, the following year, was signed by Paramount to work as a sketch artist and illustrator under the tutelage of the experienced art director 'Hans Dreier' (qv). After a three-year apprenticeship, Leven went on to work for independent producer 'Samuel Goldwyn' (qv). His big break came in 1937, when he was signed under contract at 20th Century Fox as fully-qualified art director and production designer. For his first major assignment, _Alexander's Ragtime Band (1938)_ (qv), he utilised more than 85 period sets. Proficient not only with historical detail, but also instinctive about the mood or thematic requirement of a picture, he brought imagination to the look of _The Shanghai Gesture (1941)_ (qv), _Tales of Manhattan (1942)_ (qv) and varied other assignments.  Leven remained at Fox until 1947, then joined Universal (1947-48), free-lanced, had another spell with Fox (1951-52), then worked for United Artists (1953) and Warner Brothers (1954-55). In-between, he worked privately on oil and watercolour paintings, some of which found their way into private collections, or were exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Leven became best known in the 1950's for his work on the production design of _Giant (1956)_ (qv), for which he set the scene with the indelible image of an opulent Victorian mansion, contrasting like a monolith against the broad expanse of harsh Texan prairie - providing allegorical imagery of copious human materialism vis-?-vis raw nature. In 1962, Leven won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction and Set Decoration for _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), a mixture of deliberately stylised theatrically-based sets and realistic New York locations. His other notable films during this period were _The Sound of Music (1965)_ (qv) and _The Sand Pebbles (1966)_ (qv), his work being greatly facilitated by picturesque on-location shooting, respectively, in the Austrian Alps and Salzburg, and in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Boris Leven was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame in 2004. Boris Leven 11 October 1986 Los Angeles, California, USA Boris Levin Moscow, Russian Empire [now Russia]

Hal Holbrook is an Emmy- and Tony-Award winning actor who is one of the great craftsman of stage and screen. He is best known for his performance as 'Mark Twain' (qv), for which he won a Tony and the first of his ten Emmy Award nominations. Aside from the stage, Holbrook made his reputation primarily on television, and was memorable as 'Abraham Lincoln (I)' (qv), as Senator Hays Stowe on _'The Bold Ones: The Senator' (1970)_ (qv) and as Capt. 'Lloyd Bucher' (qv) on _Pueblo (1973) (TV)_ (qv). All of these roles brought him Emmy Awards, with _Pueblo (1973) (TV)_ (qv) bringing him two, as Best Lead Actor in a Drama and Actor of the Year - Special. On January 22, 2008, he became the oldest male performer ever nominated for a an Academy Award, for his supporting turn in _Into the Wild (2007)_ (qv)  He was born Harold Rowe Holbrook, Jr. on February 17, 1925 in Cleveland, Ohio. His mother was the former Eileen Davenport, a vaudeville dancer. Raised primarily in South Weymouth, Mass., Holbrook attended the Culver Academies. During World War II, Holbrook served in the Army in Newfoundland. After the war, he attended Denison University, graduating in 1948. While at Denison, Holbrook's senior honors project concerned Mark Twain. He'd later develop 'Mark Twain Tonight', the one-man show in which he impersonates the great American writer 'Mark Twain' (qv), a.k.a. Samuel Clemens.  Holbrook learned his craft on the boards and by appearing in the TV soap opera _'The Brighter Day' (1954)_ (qv). He first played 'Mark Twain' (qv) as a solo act in 1954, at Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania. The show was a success that created a buzz. After seeing the performance, 'Ed Sullivan (I)' (qv), the host of TV's premier variety show, featured him on _'Toast of the Town' (1948)_ (qv) on February 12, 1956. This lead to an international tour sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, which included appearances in Iron Curtain countries. Holbrook brought the show to Off-Broadway in 1959. He even played 'Mark Twain' (qv) for President 'Dwight D. Eisenhower' (qv).  The 1966 'Mark Twain Tonight' Broadway production brought Holbrook even more acclaim, and the Tony Award. The show was taped and Holbrook won an Emmy nomination. He reprised the show on Broadway in 1977 and in 2005. By that time, he had played Samuel Clemens on stage over 2,000 times.  Among Holbrook's more famous roles was 'The Major' in the original Broadway production of 'Arthur Miller (I)' (qv)'s 'Incident at Vichy', as 'Martin Sheen' (qv)'s significant other in the controversial and acclaimed TV movie _That Certain Summer (1972) (TV)_ (qv), the first TV movie to sympathetically portray homosexuality, and as 'Abraham Lincoln (I)' (qv) in a TV special based on 'Carl Sandburg' (qv)'s acclaimed biography of the 16th President. He also is known for his portrayal of the enigmatic 'Deep Throat' in _All the President's Men (1976)_ (qv), one of the major cinema events of the mid-'70s. In the 1990s, he had a regular supporting role in the TV series _'Evening Shade' (1990)_ (qv), playing 'Burt Reynolds''s father-in-law.

The music is fun and includes all aspects of the country genre (including bluegrass, pop, country rock, and traditional ballads) and every song is about a new aspect in my life. One song is about the trying times that I went through with my voice change and my fear that I may never sing again. Another song, 'I'm Not Me Anymore,' is about how I've grown and changed - it's my favorite. This time, I had a say in what I wanted to record and I'm so proud of this project because it's a reflection of who I am today as a young adult.

Work Editor Person actor producer Jimmy Holcomb Benton Jennings   Jimmy Holcomb James Terry Holcomb Jr. 'Liz' (1986 - present) Began acting at age seven, portraying his boyhood hero 'Robin Hood' in a school play. Thirty years later, he got to reprise the character in a professional theatrical production, plus choreographing the fight sequences.  A third generation Texan, he fulfilled another boyhood dream -- that of performing in an Alamo movie...and not just one, but two Alamo movies.  He earned a BFA in theatre arts from TCU (Texas Christian University) with additional studies in cinematography. Studies also include London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, The Film Actors Lab in Dallas, 'DeVera Marcus' (qv)' Improv Class in L.A., & numerous L.A. voice-over coaches.  Benton has performed in over 100 stage productions and national tours including 25 years with 2 partners in an award winning sketch comedy act -- 'The Gunfighters' -- with over 6000 performances nationally, quite literally everywhere from being introduced onstage by 'Tony Randall (I)' (qv) at Madison Square Garden to performing alongside 'Clayton Moore (I)' (qv) of _'The Lone Ranger' (1949)_ (qv) fame at a festival in Texas.  With a natural and nurtured knack for embodying the roles he plays, Benton has portrayed a vast swath of characters ranging from psycho killers, FBI agents, good ol' boy farmers, upscale butlers and maitre'ds, cranky patients, caring physicians, Shakespearean kings, high school janitors, news anchors, senators, paraplegic British officers and even Hitler. (He has the dubious distinction of having played Hitler five times. First on NBC'S _'Passions' (1999)_ (qv), 'David Zucker (I)' (qv)'s feature film _An American Carol (2008)_ (qv), again in the indie feature _Poolboy: Drowning Out the Fury (2011)_ (qv), on _'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'

Sonya Jean Eddy 5' 4' Concord, California, USA Female Eddy, Sonya Jean 15 June 1973 'Touriya Haoud' (qv) (4 June 2006 - present); 3 children James Gregory Vaughan, Jr., was born in Dallas, Texas, on June 15, 1973, and was raised in both the big city of Dallas and the small German town of Fredericksburg, Texas, from his preschool years through his early teens, graduating from Mesquite High in 1991. Vaughan was involved in sports, student government, and a few school talent productions. At 16, before graduating high school, he was discovered in a community back-to-school fashion show, and was immediately signed up by a local modeling agent.  With the opportunity to travel the world, he bypassed college and ventured to Milan, Italy, just months after high school graduation. Upon his arrival, he landed prestigious campaigns for the legendary designers 'Giorgio Armani' (qv) and 'Gianni Versace' (qv), further ensuring his newfound success by adding Banana Republic, 'Tommy Hilfiger' (qv), and 'Ralph Lauren' all before the age of 21.  Relocating from city to city, a life requiring only a suitcase, came to an end through his mother's influence. She encouraged him to follow his true passion: acting. Vaughan's acting career began with abundant commercial work, preparing him for what he now claims has become his life's work over the past 10 years.  In 1996, Vaughan made his television series debut as Josh Walker in the popular 'Aaron Spelling' (qv) series _'Malibu Shores' (1996)_ (qv), which soon spun off into _'Beverly Hills, 90210' (1990)_ (qv), where Vaughan played Cliff Yeager (1996-1997). Trying his hand at a few small independent films, he was cast in the popular cult films _Poison Ivy_ and _The Last Seduction (1994)_ (qv), followed by _No Small Ways (1997)_ (qv), which led him back home to Austin, Texas. Upon returning to Los Angeles, he began filming _Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror (1998) (V)_ (qv).  Vaughan spent his time between projects in a number of guest-starring television appearances in series that included _'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (1997)_ (qv), _'Any Day Now' (1998)_ (qv), _'Sabrina, the Teenage Witch' (1996)_ (qv) and _'Nash Bridges' (1996)_ (qv) before shooting a controversial 'dramody' pilot, _Student Affairs (1999) (TV)_ (qv), for Imagine Television.  Spelling Entertainment soon created a role for Vaughan as a series regular, boy-next-door Dan Gordon, on _'Charmed' (1998)_ (qv) (1999-2000). After the series ended, Vaughan quickly landed the role of Milo Mosley in _'Glory Days' (2002)_ (qv), the highly anticipated 'Kevin Williamson (I)' (qv) series. After its short television run, Vaughan began his foray into daytime drama as Diego on CBS's #1 _'The Young and the Restless' (1973)_ (qv). With rave reviews and notoriety, a Daytime Best Newcomer nomination followed, with People Magazine naming Greg Vaughan as 'One of the Sexiest Men Alive' in 2002. Finding little spare time, he still managed to appear in guest roles on both _'Will & Grace' (1998)_ (qv) and _'Still Standing' (2002)_ (qv) before jumping from one daytime drama to another. Vaughan's opportunity to grab the highly acclaimed role of Lucky Spencer on _'General Hospital' (1963)_ (qv) seems to have simply happened before anyone knew it.

Movie Episode Editor editor references William Reynolds    14 June 1910 New York-born William Reynolds was a self-effacing editor with a distinguished sixty-year career in the motion picture industry, noted for his unobtrusive, seamless work on movies of every genre, from romantic melodramas to gangster films. A graduate of Princeton University, he started in the business, moving props as part of the 20th Century Fox swing gang. Displaying a keen interest in the art of editing, he was taken under the wing of the experienced 'Robert L. Simpson' (qv), whom he accompanied to Paramount as assistant in 1935. After just two years, Reynolds was promoted to full editor, his most prestigious assignment being _Algiers (1938)_ (qv). In 1942, he moved across to 20th Century Fox, but wartime service put a temporary halt to his career. However, he did manage to sustain continuity by editing U.S. Army training films.  From 1946, Reynolds was part of a top-notch editing team assembled by 'Darryl F. Zanuck' (qv), himself a former editor and famous for his hands-on approach to post-production. During the remainder of his tenure at Fox, Reynolds cut some of the studio's best films, including the excellent sci-fi classic _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv); and glossy romances and musicals like _Three Coins in the Fountain (1954)_ (qv) and _Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955)_ (qv). Reynolds was a frequent collaborator and preferred editor for directors like 'Robert Wise (I)' (qv) and 'Joshua Logan (I)' (qv). He did some of his most acclaimed work after free-lancing for three years, back at Fox, on _The Sound of Music (1965)_ (qv) -- winning an Oscar and caustically commenting, 'when in doubt, cut to Julie Andrews' (NY Times, July 22 1997)). Free-lancing again from 1970, he edited the first half of _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv) ('Francis Ford Coppola' (qv) assigned the second half to 'Peter Zinner' (qv)) and _The Sting (1973)_ (qv) (which Reynolds regarded as one of his most demanding assignments). However, towards the end of his career, he was also involved in several significant commercial failures: _Heaven's Gate (1980)_ (qv) -- on which he also acted as executive producer, _Pirates (1986)_ (qv) and _Ishtar (1987)_ (qv). In 1977, Reynolds was named by his peers in a Film Comment poll as one of the three best-ever film editors. William Reynolds 16 July 1997 South Pasadena, California, USA (cancer) William H.

Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv). Brad Fiedel His most famous piece is the _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) theme tune.

Video Game Crew Member Series Director crew member composer Michael Stearns Alpha Barry    Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female Alpha Barry

When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who made a difference in this world. My hope still is to leave the world a little bit better for my having been here. It's a wonderful life and I love it. Contracted to make several short puppet films for IBM. Henson, James Maury 24 September 1936 Mark Levenson. _Winner's Circle: Ten Years of the UNIMA-USA Citations of Excellence In The Art or Puppetry._ Atlanta: Center for Puppetry Arts, 2002. Jim Henson never thought that he would make a name of himself in puppetry; it was merely a way of getting himself on television. The vehicle that achieved it was _'Sam and Friends' (1955)_ (qv), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the _'The Jimmy Dean Show' (1963)_ (qv) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was _Time Piece (1965)_ (qv), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show _'Sesame Street' (1969)_ (qv). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of _'Saturday Night Live' (1975)_ (qv), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that 'Sesame Street' didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer 'Lew Grade' (qv) was. This led to _'The Muppet Show' (1976)_ (qv). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made _The Muppet Movie (1979)_ (qv), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy _The Dark Crystal (1982)_ (qv), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was _'Fraggle Rock' (1983)_ (qv), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant _'The Storyteller' (1988)_ (qv) series respectively attest to.

Video Game Production Designer Producer TV Movie crew member writer Ian Fleming Alpha Barry    'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.'

I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Video Game Crew Member Producer actor director Steven Soderbergh David Leitch   'Humo' (Belgium), 6 November 2001, Iss. 3192, pg. 128, 'De zwarte periode' 'Jules Asner' (qv) (10 May 2003 - present) At one point, was interested in directing _Fantastic Four (2005)_ (qv). [on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Video Game Crew Member Producer actor director Navid Khonsari Evan Seinfeld   Raised in Iran and Canada, Khonsari was first introduced to filmmaking through his grandfather's super 8mm films. He developed an appreciation for storytelling from his grandmother, who would recite stories (both fictional and historical) from memory. Khonsari fell in love with video games after playing Pitfall on Atari.  He graduated from the University of British Columbia, and also studied at the Vancouver Film School.

Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen.

Norton, 2005. ISBN 0393061531 Spike Lee was born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20, 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from artistic, education-grounded background; his father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a schoolteacher. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating from Morehouse, Lee attended the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, _The Answer (1980)_ (qv), a reworking of 'D.W. Griffith (I)' (qv)'s The Birth of a Nation (1915)_ - a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film _Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983)_ (qv), which won a student Academy Award.  In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, _She's Gotta Have It (1986)_ (qv), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for $175,000, and earned $7 million at the box office, which launched his career and allowed him to found his own production company, 40 Acres & a Mule Filmworks. His next movie was _School Daze (1988)_ (qv), which was set in a historically black school, focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. With his _School Daze (1988)_ (qv) profits, Lee went on to make his landmark film, _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv), a movie based specifically his own neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed the racial tensions that emerge in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood on one very hot day. The movie garnered Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay, for 'Danny Aiello' (qv) for supporting actor, and sparked a debate on racial relations.  Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic _Mo' Better Blues (1990)_ (qv), the first of many Spike Lee films to feature 'Denzel Washington' (qv), including the biography of _Malcolm X (1992)_ (qv), in which 'Denzel Washington' (qv) portrayed the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and garnering an Oscar nomination for Washington. The pair would work together again on, _He Got Game (1998)_ (qv), an excursion into the collegiate world showing the darker side of recruiting college athletes, as well as the 2006 film _Inside Man (2006)_ (qv).  Spike Lee's role as a documentarian has expanded over the years, highlighted by his part in _Lumi?re et compagnie (1995)_ (qv), the Oscar-nominated _4 Little Girls (1997)_ (qv), to his Peabody Award-winning biographical adaptation of Black Panther leader in _A Huey P. Newton Story (2001) (TV)_ (qv), through his 2005 Emmy Award-winning examination of post-Katrina New Orleans in _'When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts' (2006)_ (qv) and its follow-up five years later in _'If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise' (2010)_ (qv).  Through his production company 40 Acres & A Mule Filmworks, Lee continues to create and direct both independent films and projects for major studios, as well as working on story development, creating an internship program for aspiring filmmakers, releasing music, and community outreach and support.  He is married to 'Tonya Lewis Lee' (qv), and they have two sons, Satchel and Jackson.

Dolph helps interprets everything the interviewers say to Kojima. The human body is supposed to be 70 percent water. I consider myself 70 percent film. Provides audio commentary for the DVD of _Vital (2004)_ (qv). 24 August 1963 Hideo Kojima was born August 24th, 1963 in Setagaya, Tokyo, later moving to Kobe and growing up there. His love of Americana gave him his major two interests of writing and creating film, which are the causes of why he is so well known today. During the mid 1980's, his interests pushed him to pursue looking for a career in film making, but a chance discovery of Nintendo's Entertainment System gave him an interest in videogames. Searching for a job at one of the many games companies in Japan, he ended up being hired by Konami Entertainment and shunted to work on the MSX home computer department. While this may have been a blow for the willing game planner, he took the opportunity to create a handful of games for the MSX such as _Metal Gear (1987) (VG)_ (qv) and _Snatcher (1988) (VG)_ (qv). During the early 1990's Kojima worked on various games which have become instant classics such as various other versions of Snatcher, and Policenauts for the PC, 3D0, Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, along with some various other work with two Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series games in 1997 and 1998. However he had some plans for another sequel to Metal Gear which he had been quietly working away on with a few others since working on Policenauts. First shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), _Metal Gear Solid (1998) (VG)_ (qv) looked to being a major hit with many people. With each subsequent showing of the game due for release on PlayStation during 1998 caused more interest. To date Metal Gear Solid has sold over 5.5 Million copies and Kojima is widely recognized as a videogaming god, more so than the few who ever saw his previous work. Kojima himself is a very humble man, never letting his work effect his public attitude. He works long hours to strive for his goals, and always takes the time to talk to the press, sign autographs, or stay for an entire gaming show. He is always interested in the views his fans have of his work, and believes in anyone being able to create their dreams. With _Zone of the Enders Z.O.E (2001) (VG)_ (qv) and _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001) (VG)_ (qv), one of the most anticipated games ever, the world looks set to see more of Hideo's dreams come to life. Hideo Kojima 'Lib?ration' (France), 11 July 2008, by: Olivier S?guret, 'Haut de game' His games frequently feature characters that are influenced from famous Hollywood movie characters. For example, Solid Snake from Metal Gear is based on the character Snake Plisken from Escape from New York, Gillian Seed from Snatcher looks similar to Rick Deckard from Blade Runner and Jonathan Ingram and ED Brown from Policenauts look like Riggs and Murtaugh from the Lethal Weapon series.

Writer  Alexander Emmert birth notes gender name trivia mini biography birth date article height quotes 3 October 1974 Born in London while his parents were living overseas, Alexander Emmert moved to the United States as a young man. A short music career preceded his academic exploits at the University of Oregon and Harvard, after which he began a lucrative tenure as an Executive Recruiter in New York until one of his early loves in life, performing, drew him away from the corporate world.  Mr. Emmert has performed on stage and in numerous independent and studio films, as well as in television series and specials. He is a Big Four repped screenwriter and independent film producer. Emmert also served as Program Director for Encore Entertainment's Creative Theatre Group Summer Camps for Film and Theatre in 2003, prior to incorporating Invictus Films in 2004. He has directed several music videos (most recently for The Replacements/Soul Asylum/Guns N Roses bassist Tommy Stinson), and written and produced numerous historical documentaries for cable television.  Alexander Emmert wrote, produced and directed 'The Judas Kiss', which was the Grande Premiere Event at the Monaco International Festival of Film; co-produced and directed 'Between Us, Love', which is headlining the Urban World 2010 Festival in New York City, and was Assistant Producer and Assistant Director of 'Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale', which won Best Family Feature at the Newport Beach Films Festival in 2010.  While continuing to perform in front of the camera and on the stage, Mr. Emmert's producing and screenwriting career have taken flight.

Wells [on 'The Company Men'] One of the great things and one of the horrible things about the American character is this extraordinary optimism and arrogance that everything will continue to be great and keep looking up. People were living much closer to the edge than they had any right to be living. A large part of what the film is about is: Do we really need all these things and what is important in our lives? What are the values and what is it that you end up really caring about? Male Wells, John M.

Writer  J.W. Cortes birth notes gender aka name trivia mini biography Being featured on the new NBC Television action reality show Stars Earn Stripes brings together the best of both worlds for New York/New Jersey based actor J.W. Cortes., who, in addition to his acting experience, served in the U.S. Marines Corps for nearly 13 years, during which time he rose to the rank of Gunnery Sergeant, is an Iraq war veteran, having served in the beginning phases of the war in 2003 and currently serves as an Police Officer within the state of New York. After serving in the Marine Corps, JW traded in his weapons & uniforms to pursue his childhood dreams of acting and performing, only to find out later that his military background would come to serve him well in these endeavors as well.  Along with his role on Stars Earn Stripes, Cortes has also logged in some impressive acting credits...... playing a cop in the 2010 film As Good as Dead (with Cary Elwes & Andie McDowell), was featured in the 2009 independent film A Kiss Of Chaos with Adam Rodriquez (Magic Mike, CSI: Miami) and is in the soon-to-be-released Blue Caprice (Joey Lauren Adams, Isaiah Washington), a narrative feature film inspired by the events known as the Beltway sniper attacks. In addition, he stars in, wrote & directed the acclaimed short film Conscientious Objector - a film inspired by his 2003 tour of duty in Iraq (co-themovie.com) and appeared in an episode of the NBC show Mercy a couple years back. He also continues to push his artistic boundaries with plans for writing and producing films based on his unusual upbringing on the colorful Brooklyn, New York street known as 'Little Vietnam.'  Various aspects of his past certainly came into play when he starred in the New York Off-Broadway production of the romantic musical Soldier's Song, directed by highly acclaimed actress/director Angelica Page. The show also put the spotlight on Cortes' considerable singing talents and he found himself in a project where 'art imitates life'. The Brooklyn born Puerto Rican actor had lead an ironically similar life to that of his Soldier's Song character 'Jose'.  In addition to his career and work, J.W. Cortes, as an activist, contributes much of his time and talents to supporting causes close to his heart like Autism Speaks, the Epilepsy Foundation, Domestic Violence, Disabled Veterans and Self-Defense for Women, while his most important role is that of father and husband. He aspires to be the type of father he himself grew up admiring and loving, throughout his strong Latino upbringing. J.W. Cortes Played little league baseball with Julio Lugo of the Baltimore Orioles. JW Cortez Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA Male

Movie Editor Person production designer cinematographer James Glennon Charles C. Bennett   29 August 1942 'Charmaine Witus' (1977 - 19 October 2006) (his death); 4 children American cinematographer and something of a Renaissance man. The son of famed cinematographer 'Bert Glennon' (qv), James Glennon and his brothers learned photography at their father's feet. (Their mother was script supervisor 'Mary Coleman (II)' (qv).) James Glennon began work in the Warner Bros. mail room, where he often was assigned to make deliveries to studio head 'Jack L. Warner' (qv) because the other mail clerks were afraid of Warner. Warner advised Glennon to buy a motion picture camera and rent it out, offering his own services for free. Glennon did so, and thus initiated his career as a cinematographer with _Jaws of Death (1977)_ (qv). He continued to work as a camera operator on other cinematographers' films, including _The Conversation (1974)_ (qv), _Ordinary People (1980)_ (qv), and _Altered States (1980)_ (qv), before coming to notice as cinematographer on the groundbreaking _El Norte (1983)_ (qv). He worked steadily thereafter. He filmed _My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn (1985) (TV)_ (qv), the story of the actor his own father had photographed in four films. He partnered with director 'Alexander Payne (I)' (qv) on three films: _Citizen Ruth (1996)_ (qv), _Election (1999)_ (qv), and _About Schmidt (2002)_ (qv). He won an Emmy Award in 2005 for an episode of _'Deadwood' (2004)_ (qv), the Western series for which he was principal cinematographer for its entire run. He had widely varied interests. He served repeatedly as a judge in the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. He operated Malibu Water Resources, a water aeration program, and he farmed clams in the Pacific Northwest. He was extraordinarily beloved of his crews and casts for his eternal optimism and unstinting praise and encouragement. He died unexpectedly on October 19, 2006, from a blood clot resulting from surgery for prostate cancer.

I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured.

There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.

[on 'Meryl Streep' (qv)] The danger I'm talking about here is that she tends to sound boring because she's so perfect. Credited as actor, in Barbara Streisand's The Broadway Album, on the song 'Putting it Together'. _'The Directors' (1999) {The Films of Sydney Pollack (#2.4)}_ (qv) Pollack, Sydney Irwin 1 July 1934 Janet Meyer. _Sydney Pollack: A Critical Filmography._ Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., Inc., 1998. ISBN 0786404868 Sydney Pollack was an Academy Award-winning director, producer, actor, writer and public figure, who directed and produced over 40 films.  He was born on July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, Indiana, USA, to a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants. His mother, Rebecca Miller, was a homemaker. His father, David Pollack, was a professional boxer turned pharmacist. His parents divorced when he was young. His mother, an alcoholic, died at age 37, when Sydney Pollack was 16. He spent his formative years in Indiana, graduating from his HS in 1952, then moved to the New York City.  From 1952-1954 young Pollack studied acting with 'Sanford Meisner' (qv) at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. He served two years in the army, and then returned to the Neighborhood Playhouse and taught acting. In 1958, Pollack married his former student Claire Griswold. They had three children. Their son, Steven Pollack, died in a plane crash on November 26, 1993, in Santa Monica, California. Their daughter, Rebecca Pollack, served as vice president of film production at United Artists during the 1990s. Their youngest daughter, Rachel Pollack, was born in 1969.  Pollack began his acting career on stage, then made his name as television director in the early 1960s. He made his big screen acting debut in _War Hunt (1962)_ (qv), where he met fellow actor 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv), and the two co-stars established a life-long friendship. Pollack called on his good friend Redford to play opposite 'Natalie Wood (I)' (qv) in _This Property Is Condemned (1966)_ (qv). Pollack and Redford worked together on six more films over the years. His biggest success came with _Out of Africa (1985)_ (qv), starring 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) and 'Meryl Streep' (qv). The movie earned eleven Academy Award nominations in all and seven wins, including Pollack's two Oscars: one for Best Direction and one for Best Picture.  Pollack showed his best as a comedy director and actor in _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), where he brought feminist issues to public awareness using his remarkable wit and wisdom, and created a highly entertaining film, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. Pollack's directing revealed 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv)'s range and nuanced acting in gender switching from a dominant boyfriend to a nurse in drag, a brilliant collaboration of director and actor that broadened public perception about sex roles. Pollack also made success in producing such films as _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv), _The Quiet American (2002)_ (qv) and _Cold Mountain (2003)_ (qv). Pollack returned to the director's chair in 2004, when he directed _The Interpreter (2005)_ (qv), the first film ever shot on location at the United Nations Headquarters and within the General Assembly in New York City.  In 2000, Sydney Pollack was honored with the John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America as a 'defender of artists' rights.' He died from cancer on May 26, 2008, at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Pacific Palisades, California.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Actor  George Shannon gender name mini biography spouse pictorial 'Ellen' (1979 - present) After building elevators for Westinghouse elevator Company for several years, Georg Shannon started acting in commercials in Chicago and for nearly 30 years, he worked as an actor on stage, in films, and in television. In 1995, after frequently playing parts in dramas that explored the need for greater social responsibility in society, he decided that he needed to accept the challenge presented by those acting roles, that is, to commit his life to the service of others. It was time for him to enter the third act of his life, just as millions of 'Baby Boomers' were about to turn 60, he returned to college, earning a Bachelor's, Masters, and PhD in Gerontology - the last two from the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC). While still in undergraduate school, he found Gerontology, or, perhaps, more appropriately, Gerontology found him. He took a class entitled 'Women and Aging.' Aging issues and public policy, particularly long-term care, became the focus of his life just in time to help guide a generation of Americans through the third act of their lives. George has spent over a decade researching the problems associated with long-term care. George's achievements since age 55 argue against the notion that it is unrealistic to think that one can change direction at mid-life and be able to maintain a strong presence in the workforce. While earning a Master's degree and PhD at USC, he was nominated to Phi Kappa Phi, the All-University National Honor Society and Sigma Phi Omega, the National Gerontology Academic Honor Society. He has authored or co-authored seven peer-reviewed articles in peer-reviewed professional journals. In addition to his research skills and academic credentials, George worked as an actor for nearly 30 years. He studied acting for two years at Second City in Chicago and for 7 years with Lee Strasberg in his private classes and at the Actor's Studio in New York and Los Angeles. His experiences as an actor - over 50 plays in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, half a dozen features, contract roles on three daytime series, and recurring roles on two others, co-starring roles on several nighttime series - as well as having been a teacher of improvisation (five years at with an acting workshop in Los Angeles) and theater director - all of these experiences have enhanced his teaching and presentation skills. He proposes to encourage improving the public perception of the possibilities that accompany aging by promoting a positive agenda for aging adults. He sees what heretofore has been described as mid-life crisis, rather, as an opportunity for a man or woman in mid-life or beyond to take a deep breathe, look around at the possibilities and say, 'In a perfect world, what would I do now?'

Video Game Crew Member Actress actor costume designer Ruth E. Carter Paul Benjamin   Ruth E. Carter 'Serenity: The Official Movie Magazine' (USA), 2005, pg. 78-82, by: Abbie Bernstein, 'The Look of Serenity' Hampton University graduate. Took at least one yearbook picture in harlequin make up (white face, black teardrop). Ruthe Carter Female 1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

She made a choice to take a three-year hiatus from acting as a result just as her career had reached its peak. Her film career never fully recovered after she came back. She originally was offered the top Bondian love interest that 'Barbara Bach (I)' (qv) portrayed in _The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)_ (qv) by director 'Lewis Gilbert (II)' (qv) but turned it because of her initial self-imposed hiatus. The director, however, convinced her to play Holly Goodhead in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv) before she left the screen.

'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

Video Game Language Person composer language Brad Fiedel    10 March 1951 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv) (? - present) Extremely talented, prolific and versatile composer Brad Fiedel was born on March 10, 1951 in New York City. His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv). Brad Fiedel His most famous piece is the _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) theme tune.

Video Game Language Person composer language  Trevor Jones   23 March 1949 As a child in Cape Town, Trevor Jones lived opposite the Gem Cinema. The theater was so old and worn out that there was often a loss of the soundtrack, which caused him to realize its power. The fact that everyone in his family worked in film or the theater made it easy to get support in his career choice, but it was the cinema across the street that truly inspired him. At 17, Jones won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which his mother was fully behind. Not being from England, he could only stay four years, but he did not wish to return due to lack of industry and South African politics. In his third year, he won an award which brought him to the attention of the BBC, where he worked four years as a classical music reviewer, the time allowing him to become a naturalized British citizen. One day there he met Dr. Wilfrid Mellers, a professor at York Universiy, who helped him design a four-year course plan studying all types of music, from the ethnic to the avant garde, music concrete, and electronic. He then went to the British National Film School for an M.A. in film music, and he learned all aspects of filmmaking, directing, writing, and photographing many student films, and composing the music for most everybody at the university. His education in the field took twelve years.  His use of professional musicians allowed him to go straight into the industry. He initially scored shorts with 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv), and was discovered by 'John Boorman' (qv) after working on an Irish TV show. Boorman allowed him to write 55 minutes of music for _Excalibur (1981)_ (qv) in addition to the classical pieces of Wagner and Orff that were used. 'Jim Henson (I)' (qv) called him for _The Dark Crystal (1982)_ (qv) even before he had a script, and he would work on Henson projects, along with others, until Henson's death. Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work on _The Last of the Mohicans (1992)_ (qv). This success makes him frequently on call, particularly when he is in Los Angeles (where his wife and four children like to accompany him), but he wants to do small, low budget films as well as large, taking small salaries to work on film in which he is really interested. He cites 'Mark Herman (I)' (qv) and 'John Henderson (I)' (qv) among his favorite directors to work with. He has also worked well with 'Barbet Schroeder' (qv) and 'Richard Loncraine' (qv). His attention to the film as an art form is indicative in his work ethic: only one at a time. He once talked himself out of work on a film he thought needed no music. They took his suggestion and won an award. _'The Last Days of Pompeii' (1984)_ (qv) was a film in which he was brought in very late and did not meet the director or the dubbing mixer. 'That was the first and only time on a film that I'd never met the director', Jones says. Jones tries to keep from becoming typecast, wanting to work on all types of films, and not do films of the same kind all together, when composers are among the most typecast artists in the industry. His style has worked well, as he has had more films in 1997 and 1998 than in any other single year. Trevor Jones 'Vox' (Hungary), February 1999, Vol. 3, Iss. 2 (22), pg. 68, by: G?bor Szil?gyi Did not know of Var?se Sarabande's album release of his _Dominick and Eugene (1988)_ (qv) score, and has never even seen a copy. Trevor A.C. Jones The exciting thing for me is that the lowest common denominator isn't all that low or that common. The average cinemagoer is a pretty sophisticated animal; he wants to be entertained and stimulated on an increasingly higher and higher level, and really to manipulate your craft is becoming harder and harder for composers. Cape Town, South Africa Male Unused score: _I, Robot (2004)_ (qv).

Video Game Producer TV Movie Editor director writer Ian Fleming Stan Lathan    'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

Vincent Anthony Vaughn was born on March 28, 1970, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA and raised in Lake Forest, Illinois, USA.

He also has two older sisters named 'Victoria Vaughn (I)' (qv) and 'Valeri Vaughn' (qv). Vince was interested in theater early on and grabbed a spot in a Chevy commercial. Figuring he was set, he packed his bags and headed for Hollywood only to become a struggling actor losing role after role. He managed to hit a few spots on television, but his real goal was to make it to the big screen. He made his first credited role in the film _Rudy (1993)_ (qv) where he met his friend 'Jon Favreau' (qv), who was writing a script detailing his life as an out-of-work actor. Vince was written into _Swingers (1996)_ (qv) by Jon to play the character of 'Trent'. He signed on just as a favor to his buddy, not realizing it would be a career changing role. Though not a commercial success, it was a critical success in which 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) saw him and cast him in the big budget sequel _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv). This role gave Vince the exposure he needed to become a movie star and, for the first time, choose the roles he wanted to take. _A Cool, Dry Place (1998)_ (qv) put him as a loving father, _Return to Paradise (1998)_ (qv) cast him as a man having to make a life or death decision to save a friend, and _Clay Pigeons (1998)_ (qv) cast him as an interesting serial killer.

Video Game Actress Writer writer costume designer David Morrell Tom Bronson   24 April 1943 David Morrell was born in 1943, shortly after his father was killed in action. His mother could not both raise him and have a job, so David was sent to an orphange. He went to Pennsylvania State University from 1966-70, where he was inspired by his teacher, writer William Tenn. In 1972 he wrote _First Blood (1982)_ (qv), which later became the legendary movie introducing John Rambo played by 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv) in 1982. He was a professor of American literature at the University of Iowa and taught from 1970 to 1986, where he resigned. In 1987 he lost his 15 year old son Matthew because of bone cancer. He left Iowa and today he lives with his wife and daughter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He has written several novels and First Blood is probably the most famous. David Morrell 'Knave' (UK), 1986, Vol. 18, Iss. 6, pg. 60-64, by: William Alland, 'The Man Who Made Rambo' David Morrell actually wrote _First Blood (1982)_ (qv) at the same time he was writing his dissertation on American literature, and submitted both at the same time. When his agent called to tell him of the sale, Morrell actually thought he was talking about his dissertation being accepted. The first scripts [for _Rambo III (1988)_ (qv)) I saw were excellent, particular the character of a fortyish female French physician who takes care of Afghan children injured during the war. The story had an epical RAMBO OF ARABIA feel. But for budgetary and other reasons, the scripts got simpler until the released film felt like a cartoon. One of the subtexts I added was that the Soviet War with Afghanistan was a version of America's involvement in Vietnam, with similar fracturing effects to each country's veterans and culture.

Video Game Producer TV Movie Writer actress writer Ian Fleming  Samantha Bond birth notes gender other works name trivia birth date spouse height quotes 'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department. (1965) Novel (published posthumously): 'The Man With The Golden Gun' (filmed as _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv)) _'Explorations' (1956) {Ian Fleming: The Brain Behind Bond}_ (qv) 28 May 1908 'John Pearson (III)' (qv). _The Life of Ian Fleming._ London, England: Jonathon Cape Ltd., 1966. Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

ISBN 0786404868 Sydney Pollack was an Academy Award-winning director, producer, actor, writer and public figure, who directed and produced over 40 films.  He was born on July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, Indiana, USA, to a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants. His mother, Rebecca Miller, was a homemaker. His father, David Pollack, was a professional boxer turned pharmacist. His parents divorced when he was young. His mother, an alcoholic, died at age 37, when Sydney Pollack was 16. He spent his formative years in Indiana, graduating from his HS in 1952, then moved to the New York City.  From 1952-1954 young Pollack studied acting with 'Sanford Meisner' (qv) at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. He served two years in the army, and then returned to the Neighborhood Playhouse and taught acting. In 1958, Pollack married his former student Claire Griswold. They had three children. Their son, Steven Pollack, died in a plane crash on November 26, 1993, in Santa Monica, California. Their daughter, Rebecca Pollack, served as vice president of film production at United Artists during the 1990s. Their youngest daughter, Rachel Pollack, was born in 1969.  Pollack began his acting career on stage, then made his name as television director in the early 1960s. He made his big screen acting debut in _War Hunt (1962)_ (qv), where he met fellow actor 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv), and the two co-stars established a life-long friendship.

His biggest success came with _Out of Africa (1985)_ (qv), starring 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) and 'Meryl Streep' (qv). The movie earned eleven Academy Award nominations in all and seven wins, including Pollack's two Oscars: one for Best Direction and one for Best Picture.  Pollack showed his best as a comedy director and actor in _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), where he brought feminist issues to public awareness using his remarkable wit and wisdom, and created a highly entertaining film, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. Pollack's directing revealed 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv)'s range and nuanced acting in gender switching from a dominant boyfriend to a nurse in drag, a brilliant collaboration of director and actor that broadened public perception about sex roles.

Movie Episode Writer references composer  Nino Rota   3 December 1911 Born in Milan in 1911 into a family of musicians, Nino Rota was first a student of Orefice and Pizzetti. Then, still a child, he moved to Rome where he completed his studies at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1929 with Alfredo Casella. In the meantime, he had become an 'enfant prodige', famous both as a composer and as an orchestra conductor. His first oratorio, 'L'infanzia di San Giovanni Battista,' was performed in Milan and Paris as early as 1923 and his lyrical comedy, 'Il Principe Porcaro,' was composed in 1926. From 1930 to 1932, Nino Rota lived in the USA. He won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Philadelphia where he attended classes in composition taught by Rosario Scalero and classes in orchestra taught by 'Fritz Reiner' (qv). He returned to Italy and earned a degree in literature from the University of Milan. In 1937, he began a teaching career that led to the directorship of the Bari Conservatory, a title he held from 1950 until his death in 1979. After his 'childhood' compositions, Nino Rota wrote the following operas: Ariodante (Parma 1942), Torquemada (1943), Il cappello di paglia di Firenze (Palermo 1955), I due timidi (RAI 1950, London 1953), La notte di un neurastenico (Premio Italia 1959, La Scala 1960), Lo scoiattolo in gamba (Venezia 1959), Aladino e la lampada magica (Naples 1968), La visita meravigliosa (Palermo 1970), Napoli milionaria (Spoleto Festival 1977). He also wrote the following ballets: La rappresentazione di Adamo ed Eva (Perugia 1957), La Strada (La Scala 1965), Aci e Galatea (Rome 1971), Le Moli?re imaginaire (Paris and Brussels 1976) and Amor di poeta (Brussels 1978) for Maurice B?jart. In addition, there are countless works for orchestra that have been performed since before World War II and are still performed by orchestras in every part of the world. His work in film dates back to the early forties. His filmography includes the names of virtually all of the noted directors of his time. First among these is 'Federico Fellini' (qv). He wrote all of the movie scores for Fellini's films from _Lo sceicco bianco (1952)_ (qv) in 1952 to _Prova d'orchestra (1978)_ (qv) in 1978. Other directors include 'Renato Castellani' (qv), 'Luchino Visconti' (qv), 'Franco Zeffirelli' (qv), 'Mario Monicelli' (qv), 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv) (Oscar for best original score for _The Godfather: Part II (1974)_ (qv)), 'King Vidor' (qv), 'Ren? Cl?ment' (qv), 'Edward Dmytryk' (qv), and 'Eduardo de Filippo'. He also composed the music for many theatre productions by Visconti, Zefirelli, and de Filippo. In February of 1995, the Nino Rota Foundation was established at Fondazione Cini of Venice, Italy. Cini specializes in the works of 20th century Italian composers and includes the estate of Casella.

Series Producer Person writer cinematographer Robert Clouse  David Eggby birth notes gender aka name trivia nick names birth date 6 March 1928 A hard-working director throughout his long and varied career, Robert Clouse is known best for his two most successful films: _Enter the Dragon (1973)_ (qv) and _Game of Death (1978_. Clouse was a director who worked mainly in the visuals of cinema, owing to the fact that he was completely deaf, he employed assistant directors who could verify that actors had delivered their lines correctly. After being hired by Warner Bros. and Golden Harvest to direct _Enter the Dragon (1973)_ (qv), Clouse was escalated into the realm of profitable directors. But, unlike others in this category, doors in Hollywood were not entirely open to him. Clouse was, in 1974, hired to direct _Black Belt Jones (1974)_ (qv) for Warner Brothers Pictures.

In 1978, Clouse returned to Hong Kong where he was hired by Golden Harvest's 'Raymond Chow' (qv) to direct a comeback movie for Martial Artist 'Bruce Lee', despite the fact that Lee had died five years earlier. Clouse was given the incomplete footage from Bruce Lee's original version of Game of Death, but decided that only a small amount of this footage should be used (mainly because the original film's plot had been re-created countless times in Hong Kong cinema since Lee's death). With the help of Lee companions such as 'Samo Hung' and 'Bob Wall', Clouse shot several 'Bruce Lee' lookalikes and stand-ins as well as cutting back to footage from other Lee movies and, of course, the original Game of Death takes.  Despite attempts, Clouse was unable to match the success of his two 'Bruce Lee' films later in his career. Robert Clouse, the director of the film that many call the perfect Martial Arts movie _Enter the Dragon (1973)_ (qv), died on February 4, 1997.

His father Sol was a cinematographer for Fox Movietone News and his uncle 'Morrie Roizman' (qv) was a film editor. Owen studied math and physics at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. He began his career shooting TV commercials, and made his feature debut as a director of photography with the obscure and little seen 1970 movie _Stop (1970)_ (qv). Owen brought a strong and compelling sense of raw, gritty, documentary-style realism to 'William Friedkin' (qv)'s harsh and hard-hitting police action thriller classic _The French Connection (1971)_ (qv). Roizman received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for his outstanding visual contributions to this picture; he went on to garner four additional Oscar nominations, for _The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv), _Tootsie (1982)_ (qv), _Network (1976)_ (qv) and _Wyatt Earp (1994)_ (qv). Owen gave a similar rough and grainy look to the edgy urban thrillers _The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)_ (qv) and _Straight Time (1978)_ (qv). His other films encompass an impressively diverse array of different genres which include horror ('The Exorcist'), science fiction (_The Stepford Wives (1975)_ (qv)), comedy (_The Heartbreak Kid (1972)_ (qv) 'Tootsie'), musicals (_Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978)_ (qv)), drama (_True Confessions (1981)_ (qv), _Absence of Malice (1981)_ (qv)) and even Westerns (_The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976)_ (qv), 'Wyatt Earp'). His last feature to date was _French Kiss (1995)_ (qv). In the early 1980s Owen took a hiatus from shooting films and formed the commercial production company Roizman and Associates. He has directed and/or photographed hundreds of TV commercials. In 1997 he was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Cinematographers.

Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.'

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

I've got a new life now, a new future, there's a lot more to Lennox Lewis than just being a boxer. I am very sure about my decision. TV and internet commercials for Red Stripe beer. (2004) Lewis, Lennox Claudius 2 September 1965 (February 2004) Announced his retirement from boxing stating he 'had nothing left to prove.' After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of 'Riddick Bowe' (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer 'Emanuel Steward' (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter 'Don King (I)' (qv)'s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of 'Nelson Mandela' (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis' failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) and beaten him 'easily' in 8 rounds.

[1984, in an interview in the CMA's 'Close Up' magazine] I did more drugs than anybody you ever saw in your life. Album: 'Nashville Rebel' _Waylon: Renegade. Outlaw. Legend. (2002) (V)_ (qv) Jennings, Waylon Arnold 15 June 1937 Hoss Waylon Jennings. _Waylon._ Warner Publications Jennings, a singer, songwriter and guitarist, recorded 60 albums and had 16 No. 1 country singles in a career that spanned five decades. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October 2001. With pal 'Willie Nelson' (qv), Jennings performed duets like 'Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys', 'Luckenbach' and 'Good Hearted Woman'. Those 1970s songs nurtured a progressive sound and restless spirit embraced later by 'Travis Tritt' (qv), 'Charlie Daniels (I)' (qv), 'Steve Earle (I)' (qv) and others. His resonant, authoritative voice also was used to narrate the popular TV show _'The Dukes of Hazzard' (1979)_ (qv). He sang its theme song, which was a million seller. 'I aimed the narration at children and it made it work,' he said in a 1987 AP interview. He traditionally wore a black cowboy hat and ebony attire that accented his black beard and mustache. Often reclusive when not on stage, he played earthy music with a spirited, hard edge. Combined, Jennings had a well-defined image that matched well with his history of battling record producers to do music his way. About his independence, he said: 'There's always one more way to do something-- your way.' Some of his album titles nourished his brash persona: 'Lonesome, On'ry and Mean,' 'I've Always Been Crazy,' 'Nashville Rebel,' 'Ladies Love Outlaws' and 'Wanted: The Outlaws.' He often refused to attend music awards shows on grounds performers should not compete against each other. Despite those sentiments, Jennings won two Grammy awards and four Country Music Association awards. He did not attend his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame last year. In 1959, his career was nearly cut short by tragedy. He was scheduled to fly on the light plane that crashed and killed 'Buddy Holly' (qv), 'Ritchie Valens' and 'The Big Bopper' (qv). Jennings gave up his seat on the plane to 'The Big Bopper' (qv), who was ill and wanted to fly rather than travel by bus with those left behind. He and Holly were teen-age friends in Lubbock, Texas, and Jennings was in Holly's band. 'Mainly what I learned from Buddy was an attitude,' Jennings said. 'He loved music, and he taught me that it shouldn't have any barriers to it.' Born in Littlefield, Texas, Jennings became a radio disc jockey at 14 and formed his own band not long afterward. By the early 1960s Jennings was playing regularly at a nightclub in Phoenix. In 1963, he was signed by 'Herb Alpert''s A&M Records, then was signed by RCA in Nashville shortly thereafter by 'Chet Atkins (I)' (qv). Once in Nashville, he and Cash became friends and roommates. His hit records began in the mid-1960s and his heyday was the mid-1970s. About his outlaw image, he said: 'It was a good marketing tool. In a way, I am that way. You start messing with my music, I get mean. As long was you are honest and up front with me, I will be the same with you. But I still do things my way.'

Video Game Episode Producer Director editor composer Arthur Schmidt Michael Stearns    17 June 1937 Arthur Schmidt Arthur Robert Schmidt Los Angeles, California, USA Male Schmidt, Arthur Robert Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female

His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv).

In film, he wrote and directed the scathing, but on the money satire, 'My Dinner With Ovitz.' On TV his credits include ABC's 'Boy Meets World', CBS's 'Cybill,' HBO Family's 'Crashbox', the WB's 'Family Affair' or Disney's 'The Smart Guy', for which he was recently acknowledged for his 'creation of entertainment that also enriches life,' with the Prism Award and a Humanitas nomination. He's authored the inspiring book 'Great Failures Of The Extremely Successful' (Tallfellow Press, Fall 2002) where he was able to get the greats of many different fields to share their remarkable stories of adversity. Of 'Great Failures...', Jack Canfield, co-creator of 'Chicken Soup For The Soul' said, 'When you finish reading this amazing book, you will never let failure or fear of failure stand in your way again.' Steve has more than shown his grasp of creating stories and characters that both entertain and enlighten (without it being jammed down our children's throats) in his children's picture book series, 'What If There Were No...?' (Smallfellow, 2003) and his first novel, 'The 130 Tales of Winchell Mink' (Harper Collins, 2003). This former stand-up comedian's social and political satire has been recognized as some of the funniest, yet still poignant, with his stories regularly gracing the Oped pages of major newspapers across the country and his tongue-in-cheek punditing seen on CNN and Fox News. As contributing editor at the Writer Guild Of America's 'Written By' magazine, Steve's reputation has given him serious entrance to the best writers and producers in the industry while also allowing him one more outlet to lampoon the entertainment business he so cares about. With boundless energy and enthusiasm, we can expect to see the name of Steve Young appearing on an ever-growing amount of books lining the shelves of countless bookstores. And if anyone catches Steve putting his name on these books would you please report it to your local authorities. He must be stopped! Steve Young Harvard Graduate.

With a dream to be the next Jimi Hendrix, Feresten attended Berklee College of Music in Boston.  One night, disillusioned with his career choice, Feresten thought he might feel better if he dropped four-foot fluorescent light bulbs out the window of his dorm room - just to watch them shatter on the sidewalk eight stories below. He got caught and was evicted. Soon after, Feresten saw David Letterman performing the exact same stunt on his late-night talk show, and a real light bulb went on: If network television encouraged this sort of behavior, he might have a future after all. Thus, a career in TV comedy was born.  Feresten came up through the ranks of television, working first as an intern at NBC in New York. His career took on a Hollywood fable quality when his job as the receptionist for 'Saturday Night Live' led him to pass jokes he had written to 'Weekend Update's' Dennis Miller. Eventually, Feresten's full-time job at SNL led to a staff-writing position in 1990 at 'Late Night with David Letterman,' where he wrote for five years and earned five Emmy nominations.  In 1995, Feresten left the late-night realm to join the writing staff of the groundbreaking sitcom 'Seinfeld,' where he wrote for three seasons, becoming supervising producer in 1998. During his 'Seinfeld' tenure, Feresten garnered an additional three Emmy nominations, including one for his famed 'Soup Nazi' episode, which remains part of the pop-culture vernacular.  In 2006 FOX selected Feresten to host his own Late Night series, Talkshow with Spike Feresten which Feresten also executive produced and co-wrote. Several of the show's many viral videos made HULU's all-time most viewed list beating out Family Guy and Tina Fey's Sarah Palin sketches.  In addition to 'Seinfeld' and 'Letterman,' Feresten has written and developed other television comedy, penning episodes of The Simpsons, 'Space Ghost Coast to Coast' and 'The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.' Continuing to work with Jerry Seinfeld, Feresten co-wrote the screenplay for the animated feature 'Beemovie,' and the 2012 Acura NSX Superbowl Commercial.

David R. Boyd 20 November 1984 JJ 'Ashley Spencer (I)' (qv) (8 September 2012 - present) Jeremy was born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas. His grandma directed a youth program at a local community theatre in Chorpus Christi. In school he was always in choir, one year he did a choir concert at the community theatre and it lead to acting roles. It wasn't until he did a production of The Fantasticks that he became serious about acting. He received a BFA from Ithaca College in 2007 and moved to NYC.  Shortly after moving to NYC he booked the National Tour for Whistle Down The Wind. However, he wanted to stay in NYC so he turned it down. He did a few readings and regional productions. In 2009, he booked his first Broadway show, Rock of Ages. He was a swing understudying several roles, including the lead. In December of 2009, he decided to leave Rock of Ages to play Tony in West Side Story on Wednesday evenings and Sunday matinees.  Upon leaving West Side Story, Jeremy traveled to Sarasota, Florida to play Clyde Barrow, opposite Laura Osnes, in Bonnie & Clyde. After a successful month run, he then headed to Atlanta, Georgia to film his first feature film, Joyful Noise. Todd Graff, who wrote and directed the film, happened to be at Jeremy's very first performance at Rock of Ages and cast him in the movie. His character is Randy Garrity, the rebellious grandson of G.G. Sparrow (played by Dolly Parton).  He returned to NY after being away for a few months, he was a part of some compilation concerts and readings. In the Fall of 2011, Jeremy got to fulfill a childhood dream when he was cast as Jack Kelly in Disney's world premiere production of Newsies. While Jeremy was enjoying playing Jack Kelly at night, during the day he was rehearsing for Bonnie & Clyde which would come to Broadway shortly after Newsies finished its run.  In November of 2011, Jeremy got to originate his first leading role on Broadway in Bonnie & Clyde; once again he got to play Clyde Barrow. Sadly, the production would close after only 69 performances (and Jeremy didn't miss a single performance).  Shortly after Bonnie & Clyde's closing, Jeremy announced he would be returning to Newsies to play Jack Kelly at the Nederlander theatre. Just four months into the run, Jeremy would be pulling double duty once again -- filming season 2 of NBC's hit TV show, Smash while still playing Jack Kelly in Newsies.  Jeremy left Newsies to film Smash full-time. His final performance was September 4, 2012. Season 2 of Smash will start airing on February 5, 2013 on NBC.

Boyd John or J.T. as his friend's call him was born in the small town of Union City, Tennessee, which located in the far North West corner of the state near the geological phenomenon, known as Reelfoot Lake. He was first bit by the acting bug at the age of 20, when a scene from the movie 'U.S. Marshalls' was to be filmed at Reelfoot Lake. Due to some miscommunication an opportunity to be a stand-in was lost. He would not get another opportunity to enter the entertainment business till late 2010 at the age of 36. He was laid off from a factory and was waiting to start school when he saw an ad on craigslist for court room extras in the crime reenactment show 'Sins and Secrets'. He submitted his picture and stats and was asked by production to come and fill seats for no pay. He showed up at the federal court house and asked where the show was being filmed and no one knew anything about it. Thinking he was being tricked or scammed in some way he left. Shortly after leaving he e-mailed the trickster congratulating them on the success of their little joke. They immediately emailed him back and implored him to please come back, that someone was supposed to have met him down stairs and they were very sorry for the mix-up. Once back on location he found where the show was being filmed at and instead of a jury member or seat filler in the audience, he was asked if he would mind playing the assistant defense attorney and then was asked to stay later and be the attorney in the defendant's interrogation scene. Needless to say, he had been officially bit by the bug again and has worked sporadically on more reenactments and as an extra on a few popular television shows Like 'The Vampire Diaries', 'Teen Wolf', and Necessary Roughness' and a few movies, as well as speaking roles in some independent films, all while attending school for a degree in computer networking. He is very grateful for his success so far and say's none of it would have been possible without the support of beautiful wife Arrah Ford. John T. Ford J.T. Ford Male

This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'.

If you had not heard of Brooke Shields before, this tagline from her 'Calvin Klein (I)' (qv) Jeans ad had to grab your attention. Not that she had not had a previously noteworthy resume. She was born on May 31, 1965 in New York City and, at age 12, she starred as a child prostitute in _Pretty Baby (1978)_ (qv). Could this movie even be made today? It was considered risky and controversial in 1978. It was followed by another blockbuster, the romance adventure drama _The Blue Lagoon (1980)_ (qv). Brooke has proved herself to be so much more than her early films. Her broad range of work as an adult would be quite an achievement for anyone, especially given how difficult transitioning from child actor to adult often is.  She has never stopped working, whether it be a 'Bob Hope (I)' (qv) Christmas special, her own sitcom _'Suddenly Susan' (1996)_ (qv) or as an author. She also managed to work on a degree from Princeton University. She has received a number of awards during her career, most notably The People's Choice award for 1981 through 1984 in the category of Favorite Young Performer. In 1997, she was honored again with The People's Choice award for Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series in 1997 for her work in _'Suddenly Susan' (1996)_ (qv). In her personal life, she was married in 1997 to tennis player 'Andre Agassi' (qv) and was devastated when they divorced two years later. She married for the second time in 2001 to 'Chris Henchy' (qv). She has been open about using fertility treatments to become pregnant with their daughter, Rowan, born in 2003.  When suffering debilitating depression after the birth of her daughter, she made the decision to put her feelings down on paper. Her book, 'Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression', takes a hard, honest look at what she and many other women experience after childbirth. She still lives in New York City, and is still sought after for work in movies, television, and on stage. Pretty nice list of achievements for the once 'Calvin Klein (I)' (qv) jeans girl.

Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

I do enjoy working, but not to the point where that's the only thing I focus on. 1 November 1958 (March 2008) Appearing on Broadway as Lady Macduff in Macbeth with 'Patrick Stewart (I)' (qv). One tough cookie who can definitely hold her own next to the boys on film and TV, lovely, dark-haired Rachel Ticotin has stepped up to the plate many times in strong-armed femme roles, playing everything from cops and bodyguards to military corporals. Born and raised in the Bronx, she learned the fine art of discipline at a young age with ballet training at age 8. She made her first stage appearance at age 10 as a Siamese princess in a production of 'The King and I' at NYC's City Center Theatre. At age twelve she joined the Ballet Hispanico of New York and went on to work with such famed choreographers as 'Alvin Ailey' (qv), 'Geoffrey Holder' (qv) and 'Anna Sokolow' (qv). She made her film debut at age 20 in a bit role as a gypsy dancer in the _King of the Gypsies (1978)_ (qv) starring 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv). She gained valuable experience in off-Broadway shows and on the other side of the camera as a production assistant for such films as _The Wanderers (1979)_ (qv), _Dressed to Kill (1980)_ (qv) and _Raging Bull (1980)_ (qv).  Rachel earned her big break after being handed the top female role opposite 'Paul Newman (I)' (qv) and 'Edward Asner' (qv) in the brutal police film _Fort Apache the Bronx (1981)_ (qv). Television became a viable forum with the TV pilot _For Love and Honor (1983) (TV)_ (qv) as Corporal Grace Pavlik. The pilot introduced her to up-and-coming actor 'David Caruso (I)' (qv). They married later that year. Rachel went on to appear in the short-lived series version of _'For Love and Honor' (1983)_ (qv) without Caruso. Other television projects included assertive roles in _Prison Stories: Women on the Inside (1991) (TV)_ (qv), _Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999) (TV)_ (qv) and _Warden of Red Rock (2001) (TV)_ (qv). On the big screen she played tough in _Critical Condition (1987)_ (qv), _Where the Day Takes You (1991)_ (qv), and _Falling Down (1993)_ (qv).  Her best known role is probably the 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv) sci-fi blockbuster _Total Recall (1990)_ (qv) in which the athletic Rachel has a memorable fisticuffs scene with 'Sharon Stone (I)' (qv). In 1997, Rachel earned an ALMA award for her role as a prison guard in _Con Air (1997)_ (qv). Divorced from Caruso after six years in 1989, she later met actor 'Peter Strauss (I)' (qv) on the set of the TV movie _Thicker Than Blood: The Larry McLinden Story (1994) (TV)_ (qv). They married in 1998. In series drama she joined the cast of _'Ohara' (1987)_ (qv) as a U.S. attorney and played detective in the police drama _'Crime & Punishment' (1993)_ (qv).  Although she has yet to hit the very top rungs of stardom, Rachel is a proven talent. Alluring as well as enduring, her latest work in the popular films _Something's Gotta Give (2003)_ (qv) starring 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv) and Oscar-nominated 'Diane Keaton' (qv), _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv) with 'Denzel Washington' (qv) and the recent _The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)_ (qv), not to mention the critically acclaimed bi-cultural series _'American Family' (2002)_ (qv), is proof of the pudding.

Crew Member TV Movie Actress editor actress Kira Burt Steve Mirkovich   25 April 1969 Kira started working as a production assistant for a company that produced local and national commercials at the age of 16. Even though she looked young for her age, her first 'on camera' role was as a cocktail waitress in an Ernie Cash music video. (cousin to Johnny)  She went off to college and got a degree in film and video production at the University of the Arts in 1991. Because the heads of the department were only familiar with film, she had to edit her projects on the fly in her living room by hooking a video camera and her stereo up to a VCR. Her favorite project was a chase film she produced starring her roommate Heather and a Parmesan cheese can. By her senior year, she had convinced the department heads to get a video edit bay, but since they weren't familiar with the equipment, Kira wrote a quick 'how-to' book for operating it.  After spending a decade in Las Vegas following her graduation from film school and spending her 20's doing jobs varying from designing slot machine glass, to being a concierge at Mandalay Bay and DeeJaying, she missed the technical side of being involved with film, so she moved to Los Angeles and got a job at a motion picture advertising or 'trailer' house. She started off as a runner, driving packages around to the various studios and eventually developed an assistant editing department at her first trailer house.  While still assisting the editors, she cut her own editing teeth in her free time, basically teaching herself the AVID system. Luckily the company was very supportive of people moving up and with the help of other seasoned editors to learn the ropes, she finally was given her own edit bay.  Her first year she worked on campaigns for Kill Bill I and II, Cold Mountain and Nip/Tuck's premiere season on FX among others. She would also lend her voice talent to dub in various female voices including the female flight attendant voice in the Anger Management trailer.  Kira continues to live and work in Los Angeles as a film editor in motion picture and on-air advertising. Kira Burt 5' 6 1/2' Baltimore, Maryland, USA Female Steve Mirkovich Father of Tim Mirkovich.

Video Game Genre Person composer genre Jerry Goldsmith    'Starlog' (USA), August 1988, Vol. 12, Iss. 133, pg. 18-21,+69, by: Marc Shapiro, 'Jerry Goldsmith: Scoring the Fantastic' 'Carol Heather Goldsmith' (qv) (23 July 1972 - 21 July 2004) (his death); 1 child Frequently chose 'Alexander Courage' (qv) as orchestrator for his scores. I would have burned out a long time ago if I just took a job, the money and ran with it. There's still a challenge for me in scoring films. I'm willing to tackle an interesting project if it offers me a chance to do something I haven't done before. When I'm excited about something, the creativity just flows. I like a good creative fight. The soundtrack will always get done. But I'm not happy until it gets done well. Cantata, 'Christus Apollo' (1969), text by 'Ray Bradbury' (qv). _Film Music Masters: Jerry Goldsmith (1995) (V)_ (qv) Goldsmith, Jerrald King 10 February 1929 Born February 1929, Jerry Goldsmith studied piano with 'Jakob Gimpel' (qv) and composition, theory, and counterpoint with 'Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco' (qv). He also attended classes in film composition given by 'Mikl?s R?zsa (I)' (qv) at the Univeristy of Southern California. In 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. There, he was given his first embryonic assignments as a composer for radio shows such as 'Romance' and 'CBS Radio Workshop.' He wrote one score a week for these shows, which were performed live on transmission. He stayed with CBS until 1960, having already scored _'The Twilight Zone' (1959)_ (qv). He was hired by Revue Studios to score their _'Thriller' (1960)_ (qv) series. It was here that he met the influential film composer 'Alfred Newman' (qv) who hired Goldsmith to score the film _Lonely Are the Brave (1962)_ (qv), his first major feature film score. An experimentalist, Goldsmith constantly pushed forward the bounds of film music: _Planet of the Apes (1968)_ (qv) included horns blown without mouthpieces and a bass clarinetist fingering the notes but not blowing. He was unafraid to use the wide variety of electronic sounds and instruments which had become available, although he did not use them for their own sake.  He rose rapidly to the top of his profession in the early to mid-1960s, with scores such as _Freud (1962)_ (qv), _A Patch of Blue (1965)_ (qv), and _The Sand Pebbles (1966)_ (qv). In fact, he received Oscar nominations for all three and another in the 1960s for _Planet of the Apes (1968)_ (qv). From then onwards his career and reputation was secure and he scored an astonishing variety of films during the next 30 years or so, from _Patton (1970)_ (qv) to _Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)_ (qv) and from _Chinatown (1974)_ (qv) to _The Boys from Brazil (1978)_ (qv).  He received 17 Oscar nominations but won only once, for _The Omen (1976)_ (qv) in 1977 (Goldsmith himself dismissed the thought of even getting a nomination for work on a 'horror show'). He enjoyed giving concerts of his music and performed all over the world, notably in London, where he built up a strong relationship with 'London Symphony Orchestra' (qv).  He died in July of 2004 after a long battle with cancer. Jerry Goldsmith 'Vimagazino' (Greece), 1 August 2004, Iss. 198, pg. 26, by: Dimitris Pantsos, 'Giati klaine oloi sto enterpraiz?' 21 July 2004 Best known for composing the music for the 'Star Trek' franchise Jerrald Goldsmith Pasadena, California, USA Male

Video Game Genre Person composer genre   Trevor Jones birth notes gender other works aka name trivia mini biography birth date article quotes 23 March 1949 As a child in Cape Town, Trevor Jones lived opposite the Gem Cinema. The theater was so old and worn out that there was often a loss of the soundtrack, which caused him to realize its power. The fact that everyone in his family worked in film or the theater made it easy to get support in his career choice, but it was the cinema across the street that truly inspired him. At 17, Jones won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which his mother was fully behind. Not being from England, he could only stay four years, but he did not wish to return due to lack of industry and South African politics. In his third year, he won an award which brought him to the attention of the BBC, where he worked four years as a classical music reviewer, the time allowing him to become a naturalized British citizen. One day there he met Dr. Wilfrid Mellers, a professor at York Universiy, who helped him design a four-year course plan studying all types of music, from the ethnic to the avant garde, music concrete, and electronic. He then went to the British National Film School for an M.A. in film music, and he learned all aspects of filmmaking, directing, writing, and photographing many student films, and composing the music for most everybody at the university. His education in the field took twelve years.  His use of professional musicians allowed him to go straight into the industry. He initially scored shorts with 'Roger Christian (I)' (qv), and was discovered by 'John Boorman' (qv) after working on an Irish TV show. Boorman allowed him to write 55 minutes of music for _Excalibur (1981)_ (qv) in addition to the classical pieces of Wagner and Orff that were used. 'Jim Henson (I)' (qv) called him for _The Dark Crystal (1982)_ (qv) even before he had a script, and he would work on Henson projects, along with others, until Henson's death. Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work on _The Last of the Mohicans (1992)_ (qv). This success makes him frequently on call, particularly when he is in Los Angeles (where his wife and four children like to accompany him), but he wants to do small, low budget films as well as large, taking small salaries to work on film in which he is really interested. He cites 'Mark Herman (I)' (qv) and 'John Henderson (I)' (qv) among his favorite directors to work with. He has also worked well with 'Barbet Schroeder' (qv) and 'Richard Loncraine' (qv). His attention to the film as an art form is indicative in his work ethic: only one at a time. He once talked himself out of work on a film he thought needed no music. They took his suggestion and won an award. _'The Last Days of Pompeii' (1984)_ (qv) was a film in which he was brought in very late and did not meet the director or the dubbing mixer. 'That was the first and only time on a film that I'd never met the director', Jones says. Jones tries to keep from becoming typecast, wanting to work on all types of films, and not do films of the same kind all together, when composers are among the most typecast artists in the industry. His style has worked well, as he has had more films in 1997 and 1998 than in any other single year. Trevor Jones 'Vox' (Hungary), February 1999, Vol. 3, Iss. 2 (22), pg. 68, by: G?bor Szil?gyi Did not know of Var?se Sarabande's album release of his _Dominick and Eugene (1988)_ (qv) score, and has never even seen a copy. Trevor A.C. Jones The exciting thing for me is that the lowest common denominator isn't all that low or that common. The average cinemagoer is a pretty sophisticated animal; he wants to be entertained and stimulated on an increasingly higher and higher level, and really to manipulate your craft is becoming harder and harder for composers.

In the 1980s, he was responsible for some of entertainment's most popular and enduring motion pictures. In the 1990s, this exceptional and unique producer continued that tradition, bringing audiences worldwide films that thrill, excite and delight. His tremendous contributions to the entertainment industry are dearly missed and there will always be an empty seat at the theatre.  A look back at the films that begin with the dual lightning bolt. With worldwide revenues of over $10 billion in box office, video and recording receipts, Simpson earned not only the acclaim and respect of the entertainment industry but the devotion of moviegoers worldwide.  Simpson was a native of Anchorage, Alaska, and spent several years as a senior executive at Paramount Pictures before becoming President of Worldwide Production at Paramount. As president, Simpson was instrumental in the making of such films as _American Gigolo (1980)_ (qv), _Urban Cowboy (1980)_ (qv), _Little Darlings (1980)_ (qv), _An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)_ (qv) and _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv). The years at Paramount fueled Simpson's creativity, provided him with invaluable experience and inspired him to take on his own projects. The first was the 1983 smash hit _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv), which grossed $100 million in the U.S. alone and made an instant star of 'Jennifer Beals' (qv). It also paired Simpson with an old acquaintance, 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who would be his partner for the next 14 years.  One of the most prolific partnerships in motion picture history, Simpson and Bruckheimer produced films that were honored with 15 Academy Award nominations, two Oscars for Best Song, four Grammys, three Golden Globes, two People's Choice Awards for Best Picture, and the MTV award for Best Picture of the Decade. Equally important to Simpson, creatively, was the fact that the films were turning the stars into box office giants. _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) launched 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv)'s career and _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) made 'Tom Cruise' (qv) an international superstar.  Industry acclaim followed the box office success. In both 1985 and 1988, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) named Simpson Producer of the Year. And in 1988, along with his partner, Simpson was chosen as the Motion Picture Showman of the Year by the Publicists Guild of America.  Simpson and Bruckheimer were one of the most distinguished producing teams in motion picture history. Throughout the Eighties, they connected with such smash hits as _Flashdance (1983)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Beals' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv), _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv), _Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)_ (qv) with 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) and _Days of Thunder (1990)_ (qv) with 'Tom Cruise' (qv) as 'Cole Trickle'.  By 1995, the team was producing one hit after another. In that year alone, Simpson was responsible for _Bad Boys (1995)_ (qv), the 'Will Smith (I)' (qv)/'Martin Lawrence (I)' (qv) film that was Columbia Pictures' highest grossing movie of the year; 'Michelle Pfeiffer' (qv)'s acclaimed _Dangerous Minds (1995)_ (qv); and _Crimson Tide (1995)_ (qv), the 'Denzel Washington' (qv)/'Gene Hackman' (qv) adventure thriller.  In 1996, Simpson produced _The Rock (1996)_ (qv) starring 'Sean Connery' (qv) and 'Nicolas Cage' (qv). The film brought in nearly $350 million worldwide at the box office, and set the video rental market record as the most-ordered film in history. _The Rock (1996)_ (qv), named Favorite Movie of the Year by the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), was Simpson's last movie. Don Simpson died in 1996. Don Simpson 'Cinema' (Hungary), March 1999, Iss. 88, pg. 94-95, by: Heiko Rosner, 'A f?rfi, akit Caligul?nak h?vtak' 19 January 1996 Donald C.

The son of famed cinematographer 'Bert Glennon' (qv), James Glennon and his brothers learned photography at their father's feet. (Their mother was script supervisor 'Mary Coleman (II)' (qv).) James Glennon began work in the Warner Bros. mail room, where he often was assigned to make deliveries to studio head 'Jack L. Warner' (qv) because the other mail clerks were afraid of Warner. Warner advised Glennon to buy a motion picture camera and rent it out, offering his own services for free. Glennon did so, and thus initiated his career as a cinematographer with _Jaws of Death (1977)_ (qv). He continued to work as a camera operator on other cinematographers' films, including _The Conversation (1974)_ (qv), _Ordinary People (1980)_ (qv), and _Altered States (1980)_ (qv), before coming to notice as cinematographer on the groundbreaking _El Norte (1983)_ (qv). He worked steadily thereafter. He filmed _My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn (1985) (TV)_ (qv), the story of the actor his own father had photographed in four films. He partnered with director 'Alexander Payne (I)' (qv) on three films: _Citizen Ruth (1996)_ (qv), _Election (1999)_ (qv), and _About Schmidt (2002)_ (qv). He won an Emmy Award in 2005 for an episode of _'Deadwood' (2004)_ (qv), the Western series for which he was principal cinematographer for its entire run. He had widely varied interests. He served repeatedly as a judge in the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. He operated Malibu Water Resources, a water aeration program, and he farmed clams in the Pacific Northwest. He was extraordinarily beloved of his crews and casts for his eternal optimism and unstinting praise and encouragement. He died unexpectedly on October 19, 2006, from a blood clot resulting from surgery for prostate cancer.

I had known Jim for thirteen or fourteen years at that point and I had worked with him on everything he had done with this group of Muppets. Not Sesame Street but everything else. We worked very close together. It was super intimidating. It was a great honor to be asked and I was just scared to death. So, Brian and the family made the decision, sent me one of the puppets. I took it out of the box. I'd had the puppet on before. I'd never performed it but had had it on my hand just going around the shop. I put him on and held him up in front of a mirror. I knew how to make the puppet talk because I'd been doing this for a long time and I fiddled with some of those expressions that Jim would do with Kermit. Then I opened my mouth to say something and nothing came out. There was no way that I could find the voice. The puppet just sort of looked at me like, 'come on. You can do it'. I took it off and put it in a closet and left it there for a month. I couldn't touch it.

Series Producer Country country cinematographer Roy H. Wagner    Buddy Born in a very small community in the mid west Roy had no other contact to his dream of becoming a cinematographer than through the local theater and the Los Angeles phone directory. He would recall the names of cinematographers as they appeared on their films and call them blindly to talk with them about their work. Many of them were so suprised by this young man's ambition and interest that they took him under their wing, mentoring him. When he arrived in Los Angeles he spent every moment with them on their sets and homes learning as much about them and their work as he could. Because of this he was able to meet and befriend many of the greatest cinematographers in Hollywood. His key mentor was Harry Stradling Sr. Through him he developed friendships with Joseph Ruttenberg, George Folsey, James Wong Howe, Leon Shamroy, Frank Phillipd, Leonard South, and many many others. In the late 70s he began a life long process of interviewing cinematographers on video tape or film. A deep reverence for all that is old Hollywood remains a great part of his life and the memory of the behind the scene stories told him as a young man is an important basis for his life and work.

'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

Video Game Series Director Video Movie composer featured in  Trevor Rabin   13 January 1954 'Shelley Rabin' (1979 - present); 1 child Trevor Rabin was born in South Africa in 1954. He began playing guitar at the age of 12 after having had piano lessons since he was a toddler. In 1972 he formed the band Rabbit becoming the most successful rock act ever to emerge from South Africa. Rabin left Rabbit to pursue a solo career in London and released three solo albums.  Rabin moved to Los Angeles in 1982. Here he became a member of the newly reformed progressive art/rock group Yes for the groundbreaking 90125 album as a guitarist, keyboardist, singer, songwriter, producer and recording engineer. He penned the majority of the songs on 90125 as well as Big Generator and Talk, before leaving Yes in 1994 to pursue a career as a film composer.  Rabin has scored three dozen films which include Con Air, Homegrown, Armageddon, Enemy of the State, Jack Frost, Deep Blue Sea, Gone in 60 Seconds, Remember the Titans, The 6th Day, The Banger Sisters, Kangaroo Jack, Bad Boys 2, The Great Raid, Exorcist: The Beginning, National Treasure, Coach Carter, Snakes On A Plane, The Guardian, and Flyboys.

Video Game Series Director Video Movie composer featured in Michael Stearns     Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe. Michael Stearns Female

Video Game Series Director Video Movie composer featured in  Brad Fiedel    10 March 1951 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv) (? - present) Extremely talented, prolific and versatile composer Brad Fiedel was born on March 10, 1951 in New York City. His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv). Brad Fiedel His most famous piece is the _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) theme tune.

I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

ISBN 0345523288 The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.  In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. 'I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,' he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim ('Robert Beck (III)' (qv)). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.  As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group 'Public Enemy' (qv), it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal 'Cop Killer,' was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, 'Charlton Heston' (qv), to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.  The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series _'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' (1999)_ (qv), which is ironic for someone famous for 'Cop Killer' and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, 'Coco Austin' (qv).

Video Game Series Character Person actor references  Paul Benjamin    1938 Born and raised for a time in Pelion, South Carolina, African-American actor Paul Benjamin is the youngest of twelve children born to a Baptist preacher, the Reverend Fair Benjamin, and his wife Rosa. Paul lost his mother while still a baby and his father as a child. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was taken in by one of his older brothers, David, and his wife and family. Suppressing his teenage desires of becoming an actor due to social pressures, he attended C.A. Johnson High and, upon graduation, enrolled at Benedict College for about a year before deciding to move to New York City and pursue his dream. Studying at the 'Herbert Berghof' (qv) Studio, he finally made his professional stage debut in the late 60s at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. His theater career quickly picked up steam with such classical and contemporary plays as 'Hamlet' (1967), 'Cities in Bezique (1969), 'The Owl Answers' (1969), 'No Place to Be Somebody' (1969), 'The Year Boston Won the Pennant' (1969), 'Camino Royal' 1970, 'Operation Sidewinder' (1970), Boesman and Lena (1970), 'The Black Terror' (1971), 'Assassination 1865' (1971), 'The Cherry Orchard' (1973) and 'The Old Glory' (1976).  Benjamin made his film debut inauspiciously as a bartender in _Midnight Cowboy (1969)_ (qv), which highlighted New York's seamier side. Following small roles in _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv) and _Born to Win (1971)_ (qv), he earned a top featured role and strong notices playing a robber-turned-killer in _Across 110th Street (1972)_ (qv) co-starring 'Anthony Quinn (I)' (qv) and 'Yaphet Kotto' (qv), which again took place on the gritty New York streets. He then gave incisive, strong-armed portrayals as part of a gang in _The Deadly Trackers (1973)_ (qv) and as a lieutenant alongside 'Tony Lo Bianco' (qv) and 'Hal Linden' (qv) in the above-average TV-movie _Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside (1973) (TV)_ (qv). His film and TV career, which peaked in the 1970s, included the 'blaxploitation' scene -- he appeared with 'Mary Alice (I)' (qv) as the parents of the titular character in _The Education of Sonny Carson (1974)_ (qv) and as a senator in the 'Pam Grier' (qv) vehicle _Friday Foster (1975)_ (qv).  Throughout the decades he has worked with prestigious actors in prestigious projects yet never attained the public attention he merited. Neverthless he added solid authenticity to the musical bio _Leadbelly (1976)_ (qv); 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s _Escape from Alcatraz (1979)_ (qv); the 'Richard Pryor' (qv) comedy-drama _Some Kind of Hero (1982)_ (qv); 'Barbra Streisand' (qv)'s courtroom vehicle _Nuts (1987)_ (qv); 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s lacerating, one-two punch on urban black life in _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv); the Temptations-like story of _The Five Heartbeats (1991)_ (qv); and the excellent, fact-based drama in _Rosewood (1997)_ (qv) with racism at its core. On the mini-movie circuit he appeared in good company as 'LeVar Burton' (qv)'s father in the baseball story _One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story (1977) (TV)_ (qv), and was a noticeable factor in _Gideon's Trumpet (1980) (TV)_ (qv) starring 'Henry Fonda' (qv); 'Maya Angelou' (qv)'s _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) (TV)_ (qv); the hard-hitting _'The Atlanta Child Murders' (1985)_ (qv)_ (TV) and, perhaps most notably, the chain-gang story _The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains (1987) (TV)_ (qv) in which he portrayed Big Sam.  Paul the actor has added to his success as an award-winning playwright as well and, broaching age 70, continues to write as well as perform. His play 'Carrier', in which he appeared with 'Roscoe Lee Browne' (qv) and 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv), received special citations for its writing and performances. Paul Benjamin Mayor Tom Bradley presented Paul with a Commendation from the City of Los Angeles for Paul's play, 'Carrier,' for which 'Paula Kelly (I)' (qv) won the 1982 NAACP Image Awards for Best Actress. She, along with Paul and actor/poet Roscoe Lee Browne, received Certificates of Recognition from Sen. Diane Watson for their performances in the same play. 6' 1 1/2' Pelion, South Carolina, USA Male

(2000) Music video for Black Label Society: 'Counterfeit God' as the stand-in bass player Wahlberg, Mark Robert Michael 5 June 1971 Marky Mark Mark Wahlberg, with Lynn Goldsmith. _Marky Mark._ New York: HarperCollins, 1992. American actor Mark Wahlberg is one of a handful of respected entertainers who successfully made the transition from teen pop idol to respected actor. A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in _The Fighter (2010)_ (qv), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in _Ted (2012)_ (qv).  Born Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg on June 5, 1971 in Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. Wahlberg became involved in drugs at a young age and, following a string of pretty crimes, was convicted of assault against two men in 1988. He was sentenced to two years in state prison at Boston's Deer Island House of Correction, but served 45 days. Wahlberg cites his jail time as being his motivation to improve his life. Around this time, his older brother 'Donnie Wahlberg' (qv) had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980's boy band New Kids on the Block.  Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. This led to a modeling contract with Calvin Klein, widespread fame and a 1992 biography that he dedicated to his penis. As that last detail hints, Wahlberg tended to get in trouble with his mouth, which was feverishly reported upon in the tabloids. But it was his appearance on a British talk show with rapper Shabba Ranks that effectively ended Wahlberg's career as a hip-hop star: When Ranks made blatantly homophobic statements that Wahlberg did nothing to refute, he soon found himself accused of bigotry. His second album was a flop, and soon after Wahlberg abandoned his rap career.  Using his real name, Wahlberg made his big screen debut in 'Penny Marshall (I)' (qv)'s _Renaissance Man (1994)_ (qv). This was followed by a performance in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv) that earned him positive critical notice, and a deeply disturbing role in _Fear (1996)_ (qv) as a violent, obsessed stalker.  The major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in 'Paul Thomas Anderson' (qv)'s _Boogie Nights (1997)_ (qv). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as _Three Kings (1999)_ (qv) and _The Perfect Storm (2000)_ (qv), popcorn flicks like _Planet of the Apes (2001)_ (qv) and _Contraband (2012)_ (qv), and even indies such as _I Heart Huckabees (2004)_ (qv).  Wahlberg also is the executive producer of such television series as _'Boardwalk Empire' (2010)_ (qv), _'In Treatment' (2008)_ (qv) and the highly successful comedy _'Entourage' (2004)_ (qv), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.  Wahlberg and his wife 'Rhea Durham' (qv) have four children.

Later, she choreographed the hit film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and also began appearing in films, including the now-classic _Easy Rider (1969)_ (qv). After several films, she launched her music career with her first album, 'Word of Mouth', in 1981, which was released both as a record and a video, quite an innovation at the time. Culled from that album was a innocent little ditty called 'Mickey', which soon became a massive hit all over the world, first in Britain. The song topped the American music charts in December 1982, and the video (directed by Basil, as were all of her others) still receives airplay, today. In 1984, Toni Basil's self-titled follow-up album was released, which included the American Top 40 hit 'Over My Head'. Although she found future chart success elusive, Basil remained busy appearing in such films as _Rockula (1990)_ (qv) and has appeared in a guest shot on _'Baywatch' (1989)_ (qv) in the late 1990s. Her choreographer talents have also been utilized lately by superstars 'Bette Midler' (qv) and 'David Bowie' (qv) and, in 1998, she choreographed a successful ad for 'The Gap'.

As with many child actors, once Dickie got older the roles began to dry up.

Video Game TV Movie Actress Cinematographer actress crew member Kelly McGillis Alpha Barry    'Parade Magazine' (USA), November 1997, pg. 22, by: James Brady, 'In Step With: Kelly McGillis' 'Boyd Black' (14 April 1979 - 1981) (divorced) Wanted to play the role of 'Kathryn Murphy', the district attorney in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv), because she and her roommate were assaulted and raped by two men in their apartment in 1982. 'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

ISBN 0394438728 Fittingly known to be a 'Leo' for his horoscope, Bert Lahr is always remembered as the Cowardly Lion in (and the farmer 'Zeke') _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv). But during his acting career, he has been known for being in burlesque, vaudeville, and Broadway.  Dropped out of high school at the age of fifteen for a juvenile vaudeville act, Lahr worked his way up to the top billing of the Columbia Burlesque Circuit. When in Broadway, Lahr usually plays a comic actor in plays which he starred in such as the classic routine The Song of the Woodman, which he would later perform in _Merry Go Round of 1938 (1937)_ (qv).  Aside from _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv), Lahr's movie career never caught on because his gestures and reactions were too broad. Lahr died in 1967.

Norton, 2005. ISBN 0393061531 Spike Lee was born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20, 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from artistic, education-grounded background; his father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a schoolteacher. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating from Morehouse, Lee attended the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, _The Answer (1980)_ (qv), a reworking of 'D.W. Griffith (I)' (qv)'s The Birth of a Nation (1915)_ - a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film _Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983)_ (qv), which won a student Academy Award.  In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, _She's Gotta Have It (1986)_ (qv), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for $175,000, and earned $7 million at the box office, which launched his career and allowed him to found his own production company, 40 Acres & a Mule Filmworks. His next movie was _School Daze (1988)_ (qv), which was set in a historically black school, focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. With his _School Daze (1988)_ (qv) profits, Lee went on to make his landmark film, _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv), a movie based specifically his own neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed the racial tensions that emerge in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood on one very hot day. The movie garnered Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay, for 'Danny Aiello' (qv) for supporting actor, and sparked a debate on racial relations.  Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic _Mo' Better Blues (1990)_ (qv), the first of many Spike Lee films to feature 'Denzel Washington' (qv), including the biography of _Malcolm X (1992)_ (qv), in which 'Denzel Washington' (qv) portrayed the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and garnering an Oscar nomination for Washington. The pair would work together again on, _He Got Game (1998)_ (qv), an excursion into the collegiate world showing the darker side of recruiting college athletes, as well as the 2006 film _Inside Man (2006)_ (qv).  Spike Lee's role as a documentarian has expanded over the years, highlighted by his part in _Lumi?re et compagnie (1995)_ (qv), the Oscar-nominated _4 Little Girls (1997)_ (qv), to his Peabody Award-winning biographical adaptation of Black Panther leader in _A Huey P. Newton Story (2001) (TV)_ (qv), through his 2005 Emmy Award-winning examination of post-Katrina New Orleans in _'When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts' (2006)_ (qv) and its follow-up five years later in _'If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise' (2010)_ (qv).  Through his production company 40 Acres & A Mule Filmworks, Lee continues to create and direct both independent films and projects for major studios, as well as working on story development, creating an internship program for aspiring filmmakers, releasing music, and community outreach and support.  He is married to 'Tonya Lewis Lee' (qv), and they have two sons, Satchel and Jackson.

She seemed destined for acting from the start, having been named after silver screen actress 'Arline Judge' (qv), and her childhood was dominated by singing and acting classes. She headed to New York at the age of 19 and began a career on Broadway and in films made in New York City, generally playing bubble-headed or eccentric blondes, often prostitutes.  She relocated to Los Angeles in the late 60s. There, while continuing to play small roles on the big screen, she established one of the strongest resumes in television of any character actress, appearing in dozens of programs over the following three decades, often repeatedly on the same program and sometimes playing different characters.  Her TV appearances included such legendary programs as _'Mary Tyler Moore' (1970)_ (qv), _'All in the Family' (1971)_ (qv) and _'M*A*S*H' (1972)_ (qv). Her best-known recurring performance as the same character is probably 'Millie' on _'Mayberry R.F.D.' (1968)_ (qv).

You know, I was supposed to be on the cover and my publicist set up the shoot behind my back and I was like, 'There is no fucking way I am wearing my underpants on the cover of a magazine; they can go fuck themselves.' Sexuality in that way and women using it has been around for forever, but it seems now with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, it seems that now in order to be successful you need to look like you want to have sex with every guy. I don't get it.

Series Producer Country production country writer Ian Fleming    'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Composer  Joel Goldsmith birth notes gender death date name trivia mini biography birth date death notes 19 November 1957 One of six children of the legendary composer 'Jerry Goldsmith' (qv), and the oldest son, Joel Goldsmith's own career in film scoring began in 1978, when he collaborated with 'Richard Band' (qv) on the score for _Laserblast (1978)_ (qv). Joel Goldsmith next worked as sound mixer for another Band project, _The Day Time Ended (1979)_ (qv) before receiving his first solo scoring assignment, _Olivia (1983)_ (qv), for cult German director 'Ulli Lommel' (qv). The stylish synthesizer score Goldsmith provided was succeeded by dozens more for film and TV, including _The Man with Two Brains (1983)_ (qv) and _Man's Best Friend (1993)_ (qv). His electronic expertise came in handy when he co-produced father Jerry's first all-electronic score, _Runaway (1984)_ (qv), and helped in the same capacity for Jerry's theme from _Hoosiers (1986)_ (qv). Joel also scored episodes of the TV series _'H.E.L.P.' (1990)_ (qv), for which Jerry wrote the original theme; and Joel composed some 20 minutes of additional music (with credit) for his father's 1996 assignment _Star Trek: First Contact (1996)_ (qv).  Joel Goldsmith composed his first symphonic score, for 'Roland Emmerich' (qv)'s _Moon 44 (1990)_ (qv), in 1990. Surprisingly, this sweeping score did not lead to more similar assignments; but, in recent years, Joel Goldsmith's profile has been boosted in recent years with assignments such as TV's _Vampirella (1996) (V)_ (qv) and the 1997 cult hit _Kull the Conqueror (1997)_ (qv), another big, bold symphonic score which helped nab him the assignment _Shadow of Doubt (1998)_ (qv). Most recently, he has been the chief composer for the TV shows _'Stargate SG-1' (1997)_ (qv) and _'Stargate: Atlantis' (2004)_ (qv). While Joel's style is recognizably similar to his father's (he seems to have a particular love for Jerry's _The Wind and the Lion (1975)_ (qv)), it is recognizably distinct, which observers of the film music scene believe can only continue to ripen.

Composer  Tim Truman name mini biography Tim Truman  The musical life of Tim Truman started with the world of percussion. He immersed himself in rhythm winning awards all through his early school years topping it off with the 'Best Musician in California' at the Hollywood Bowl. His college studies began to change as it was not enough for the exploratory musician. He shifted his focus to original musical composition. He was accepted into the coveted USC composition department. From there he began scoring prime-time network television. George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola selected Tim Truman to complete the score to the 70 mm 3D Disneyland feature 'Captain EO' Starring Michael Jackson. Michael Mann hand picked Tim to replace Jan Hammer on his hit show 'Miami Vice' scoring the entire fifth season. The Michael Mann directed movie 'LA Takedown' was next gathering strong reviews. Tim then composed the original Main Title theme to 'Melrose Place' going on to score over 120+ episodes of that world wide hit. Oliver Stone asked Tim to score the controversial film 'South Central' with a full orchestra for Warner Brothers. The television and features continued with an EMMY nomination for the Main Title Theme to 'Central Park West'. The entire debut season of 'Charmed' was in Tim's hands as well. Tim has been honored with several ASCAP, Gold and Platinum album and video awards. Tim Truman won an EMMY as a co-producer on 'The Killer Whale People' with Nancy Wilson (Heart). He then Executive produced 'One World' with Olivia Newton John garnering five EMMY nominations. SHOWTIME brought in Tim to score all 35 hour episodes of 'Jeremiah' created by J. Michael Strazensky (Babylon 5). The pull to tell compelling stories, rather then just support them musically, has become central in the evolving career of Tim Truman. The fifteen million dollar original feature 'Touch of Grace' is preparing to film in 2013 with Tim at the helm. Always a believer in truth Tim is bringing to the screen a powerful story about a single mother protecting her only child, Grace, as her own mental state is deteriorating. 'Touch of Grace' is humorous, filled with humanity, tragedy, but with ultimate redemption. With thousands of productions guiding his focus, an unwavering eye for truth, Tim Truman continues to expand the possibilities of tomorrow. Tim Truman

Zmijewsky, S. Smijewzky. _The Films of John Wayne._ 1970. John Wayne (born Marion Morrison) was the son of pharmacist Clyde Morrison and his wife Mary. Clyde developed a lung condition that required him to move his family from Iowa to the warmer climate of southern California, where they tried ranching in the Mojave Desert. Until the ranch failed, Marion and his younger brother 'Robert E. Morrison' (qv) swam in an irrigation ditch and rode a horse to school. When the ranch failed, the family moved to Glendale, California, where Marion delivered medicines for his father, sold newspapers and had an Airedale dog named 'Duke' (the source of his own nickname). He did well at school both academically and in football. When he narrowly failed admission to Annapolis he went to USC on a football scholarship 1925-7. 'Tom Mix (I)' (qv) got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for football tickets. On the set he became close friends with director 'John Ford (I)' (qv) for whom, among others, he began doing bit parts, some billed as 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). His first featured film was _Men Without Women (1930)_ (qv). After more than 70 low-budget westerns and adventures, mostly routine, Wayne's career was stuck in a rut until Ford cast him in _Stagecoach (1939)_ (qv), the movie that made him a star. He appeared in nearly 250 movies, many of epic proportions. From 1942-43 he was in a radio series, 'The Three Sheets to the Wind', and in 1944 he helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a right-wing political organization, later becoming its President. His conservative political stance was also reflected in _The Alamo (1960)_ (qv), which he produced, directed and starred in. His patriotic stand was enshrined in _The Green Berets (1968)_ (qv) which he co-directed and starred in. Over the years Wayne was beset with health problems. In September 1964 he had a cancerous left lung removed; in March 1978 there was heart valve replacement surgery; and in January 1979 his stomach was removed. He received the Best Actor nomination for _Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)_ (qv) and finally got the Oscar for his role as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn in _True Grit (1969)_ (qv). A Congressional Gold Medal was struck in his honor in 1979. He is perhaps best remembered for his parts in Ford's cavalry trilogy - _Fort Apache (1948)_ (qv), _She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)_ (qv) and _Rio Grande (1950)_ (qv).

Sanford on _'Sanford and Son' (1972)_ (qv). 'Playboy' (USA), November 1976, Vol. 23, Iss. 11, pg. 252, by: Chares W. Bush, 'Grapevine: Junking the Junkman' Junk runs in the family. My granddad was a junk man in St. Louis and so was my uncle. Was a color commentator at the fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner in March 1975 _'E! True Hollywood Story' (1996) {Redd Foxx}_ (qv) Sanford, John Elroy 9 December 1922 Chicago Red Redd Foxx began doing stand-up comedy on the infamous 'Chitlin' Circuit' in the 1940s and 1950s. Foxx was one of the premier 'blue humor' comedians. Blue humor was very dirty, too dirty for white audiences. For years his party albums were not available in white record stores. In the 1960s his records became available, although marginally in white record stores, leading to minor comedy work on _'Toast of the Town' (1948)_ (qv) (aka 'The Ed Sullivan Show') and _'The Red Skelton Show' (1951)_ (qv), among other classic variety shows of the time. Foxx developed a fan base in the 1960s that led to increased notoriety. He received his own television series in 1972 called _'Sanford and Son' (1972)_ (qv), which was a reworking of the British sitcom _'Steptoe and Son' (1962)_ (qv). Foxx's character, Fred Sanford (was actually Foxx's brother's name), was a cranky old man who was set in his ways and would insult both friends and strangers at the drop of a hat. He ran a junkyard in Watts, a bad neighborhood in Los Angeles, with his son Lamont (played by 'Demond Wilson (I)' (qv)). The show broke down racial stereotypes and was a huge success, making Foxx and the show household names. Foxx fought a very public battle with the writers and producers of the show, claiming that they did not do enough to promote the black experience, and in general complained there were not enough black writers or producers in the entertainment industry. These highly publicized disputes led to the show faltering artistically, but not in the ratings. Foxx left the show in 1977 to accomplish his dream on ABC: his own variety show, which lasted less than a year. He also starred in the controversial film _Norman... Is That You? (1976)_ (qv).  Foxx's trouble with the law and the Internal Revenue Service hampered his career in the early 1980s. He flopped yet again with the sitcom _'The Redd Foxx Show' (1986)_ (qv) on ABC. He did, however, find success playing a ghost in the TV movie _Ghost of a Chance (1987) (TV)_ (qv), with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). The late 1980s found Foxx on a rebound, as he starred with 'Richard Pryor' (qv) and 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) in the popular _Harlem Nights (1989)_ (qv), which showcased the three premiere black comedians of their respective generations. A whole new generation of comedians begin claiming Redd Foxx as a major influence on their careers, including Murphy and Pryor. Foxx looked like he was finding success 20 years after _'Sanford and Son' (1972)_ (qv) with _'The Royal Family' (1991)_ (qv). However, we will never know if the show would have been a success--while rehearsing for an episode, Foxx collapsed and was rushed to a hospital. He died in October of 1991. Redd Foxx will be remembered as a pioneering comedian who influenced generations of comedians and helped break down racial barriers in the the entertainment industry. His influence seems as strong as ever.

At age 10, he left home to travel with a medicine show through the Midwest, and joined the vaudeville circuit at age 15. At age 17, he married Edna Marie Stilwell, an usher who became his vaudeville partner and later his chief writer and manager. He debuted on Broadway and radio in 1937 and on film in 1938. His ex-wife/manager negotiated a seven-year Hollywood contract for him in 1951, the same year _'The Red Skelton Show' (1951)_ (qv) premiered on NBC. For two decades, until 1971, his show consistently stayed in the top twenty, both on NBC and CBS. His numerous characters, including Clem Kaddiddlehopper, George Appleby, and the seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe delighted audiences for decades. First and foremost, he considered himself a clown, although not the greatest, and his paintings of clowns brought in a fortune after he left television. His home life was not completely happy--two divorces and a son Richard who died of leukemia at age nine--and he did not hang around with other comedians. He continued performing live until illness, and he was a longtime supporter of children's charities. Red Skelton died at age 84 of pneumonia in Rancho Mirage, California on September 17, 1997.

I don't even think of _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) as a horror movie. The horrible thing is that people like this really exist. Radio interview for the film _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) with 'William Lustig' (qv) & 'Caroline Munro' (qv). _The Joe Spinell Story (2001) (V)_ (qv) Spagnuolo, Joseph J. 28 October 1936 Joseph J. Spagnuolo was born on October 28, 1936 in Manhattan, New York City at his family's apartment on 2nd Avenue. Spinell was a tough guy on and off screen all his life. During his teen years, while still in high school, he acted in various plays on the New York stage, on and off Broadway, eventually earning a place in Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival Theater. In 1960, he parlayed his stage work into a performing contract for MGM where it was suggested that he change his name to Joe Spinell to make his name easier to pronounce. For nine years, Spinell worked with the group, which was also known as the Theater of the Forgotten, which also put on plays in prisons for the inmates. His minimal salary for his stage work forced him to hold down other jobs to make ends meet. Those jobs included working as a taxi driver, a post office clerk, and a liquor store clerk during Christmas holidays.  In 1972, Spinell was first noticed when he appeared in his first movie role which was a small, uncredited speaking part in The Godfather (1972), the right film for a tough, mean-looking Italian with a New York City accent. After his success, he became a familiar character actor that appeared in violent urban movies where he was usually cast as vicious thugs or seedy gang leaders. In both Godfather movies he was the hit man Willy Cici. In Rocky (1976), the first of several films he made with Sylvester Stallone, he was the loan shark Gazzo who employs Rocky as a collector.  His best (or worst) or most disgusting role is probably the one where is his best remembered; in a rare starring role, his character of Frank Zito in Maniac (1980) is a serial killer that kills women and uses their scalps to dress up female mannequins he keeps in his apartment. After Maniac (1980), Spinell continued acting with big-name Hollywood and independent movie directors usually playing villainous thugs in small to medium roles.  During the last years of his life Spinell's choice of projects becomes increasingly suspect; for example imprisoned serial killer John Wayne Gacy wanted Spinell to play him in a movie. But with Maniac (1980) still on his mind, Spinell always wanted to do a sequel to the movie and with New York filmmaker Buddy Giovinazzo, they shot a 10-minute promo reel in 1986 titled Mr. Robbie, which was to be the sequel for Maniac (1980). After a few years of hard work and searching, Spinell found financing for the sequel. But just as pre-production was to begin, Joe Spinell suddenly passed away in his apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, New York on January 13, 1989, at age 52 due to undetermined causes, still the subject of much speculation. Some say he died of a heart attack because of his failing health in recent months due to his heavy drinking, drug use, and the emotional turmoil resulting from his mother's death (who passed away in 1987.) Others say he died from an asthma attack, or that he bled to death from an accidental (or deliberate) cut since he was a hemophiliac.  Spinnel left behind an impressive body of film work that stands as a testament to his talent and unique screen presence as a character actor. He is survived by an ex-wife, a daughter, two brothers and a sister.

Video Game Series Director Editor composer writer Michael Stearns  Simon Moore   Michael Stearns is one of the finest musicians and synthesizer wizards to work in the so-called, poorly defined new age music genre (his specialty is ambient music, which was pioneered by 'Brian Eno' (qv)), and his music is absolutely a positive asset to any film soundtrack and a credit to the producers of films featuring his work.  Having begun his musical career as a rock musician in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1970s, and influenced by progressive rock artists such as Pink Floyd, Stearns started up his own record label in 1977, Continuum Montage, to produce his own works and others', and market them at new age outlets around the United States such as bookstores and record stores, recording the amazing sounds he produced with profundity on his mighty Serge synthesizer. His first work of note was his lush thematic opus 'Ancient Leaves' (1977), and many more followed on inexpensive but digitally mastered high-output cassette tapes until the advent of CDs in the early 1980s.  By far the most compelling and brilliant of his early musical works is the masterful, awe-inspiring opus 'Planetary Unfolding' (1981), which is the soundtrack for a nonexistent stream-of-consciousness imaginary movie voyage through space. One hears echoes of science fiction classics such as 'Louis Barron (I)' (qv)'s and 'Bebe Barron' (qv)'s marvelous tonalities heard on the score of _Forbidden Planet (1956)_ (qv) and 'Bernard Herrmann (I)' (qv)'s dramatic invasion thesis, _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv), interwoven as vibratory patterns in his works like this showing a subtle influence into his creative genius. Stearns broke new ground as an avant-garde performance artist as well with his expansive, futuristic album 'Lyra Sound Constellation' (1983), which used George Landry's musical instrument of the title as his vehicle for new musical expressions.  In 1984, Stearns signed with a new record label, Sonic Atmospheres, quietly closed down his indie label, and released his first major film soundtrack for Ron Fricke's IMAX presentation _Chronos (1985)_ (qv). Since these auspicious beginnings, Stearns has distinguished himself among his peers such as Tangerine Dream, 'Vangelis' (qv) and 'Kitar? (I)' (qv) for continually pushing the envelope and expanding the public consciousness to show what music is and can be, to the infinity of the universe.

His mother was a dancer and his father was a composer and musician. Brad started out as a keyboardist for 'Hall & Oates' (qv). Fiedel first began composing music for movies in the mid-70s for such low-budget pictures as _The Astrologer (1975/I)_ (qv), _Deadly Hero (1975)_ (qv) and the raunchy _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) porno parody _Gums (1976)_ (qv). Although best known for his strong, lively and driving scores for action movies and thrillers, Brad has displayed considerable range and skill with his equally fine scores for dramas (_Immediate Family (1989)_ (qv) and _The Accused (1988)_ (qv)), comedies (_Straight Talk (1992)_ (qv) and _Fraternity Vacation (1985)_ (qv)) and numerous made-for-TV features. Fiedel is widely regarded as a vital and creative pioneer for his expert and innovative use of electronic instruments and synthesizers in his music. Brad achieved his greatest success with the incredibly powerful and hard-charging metallic score for _The Terminator (1984)_ (qv) -- he was deservedly nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for his outstanding and unforgettable work -- and its sequel _Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)_ (qv). He collaborated with 'Terminator' director 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) a third time on the blockbuster smash _True Lies (1994)_ (qv). In addition, Fiedel supplied the chillingly effective scores for the horror pictures _Just Before Dawn (1981)_ (qv), _Eyes of Fire (1983)_ (qv), _Fright Night (1985)_ (qv), the Made-for-TV _The Midnight Hour (1985) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)_ (qv). He's also written and/or performed songs that are featured on several film soundtracks. Alas, Brad Fiedel retired from composing scores for both theatrical features and made-for-TV movies, alike, in the late 90s. He's married to actress 'Ann Dusenberry' (qv).

The new CD and children's book are expected to be released in 2007. Connie Berman (foreword by Dolly Parton). _The Official Dolly Parton Scrapbook._ New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1978. ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent.

(1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

The son of famed cinematographer 'Bert Glennon' (qv), James Glennon and his brothers learned photography at their father's feet. (Their mother was script supervisor 'Mary Coleman (II)' (qv).) James Glennon began work in the Warner Bros. mail room, where he often was assigned to make deliveries to studio head 'Jack L. Warner' (qv) because the other mail clerks were afraid of Warner. Warner advised Glennon to buy a motion picture camera and rent it out, offering his own services for free. Glennon did so, and thus initiated his career as a cinematographer with _Jaws of Death (1977)_ (qv). He continued to work as a camera operator on other cinematographers' films, including _The Conversation (1974)_ (qv), _Ordinary People (1980)_ (qv), and _Altered States (1980)_ (qv), before coming to notice as cinematographer on the groundbreaking _El Norte (1983)_ (qv).

He partnered with director 'Alexander Payne (I)' (qv) on three films: _Citizen Ruth (1996)_ (qv), _Election (1999)_ (qv), and _About Schmidt (2002)_ (qv). He won an Emmy Award in 2005 for an episode of _'Deadwood' (2004)_ (qv), the Western series for which he was principal cinematographer for its entire run. He had widely varied interests. He served repeatedly as a judge in the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. He operated Malibu Water Resources, a water aeration program, and he farmed clams in the Pacific Northwest.

When he was young, Gondry wanted to be a painter or an inventor. In the 80s he entered in an art school in Paris where he could develop his graphic skills and where he also met friends with whom he created a pop-rock band called Oui-Oui. The band released 2 albums ('Chacun tout le monde' and 'Formidable') and several singles until their separation in 1992. Gondry was the drummer of the band and also directed their video clips in which it was possible to see his strange world, influenced by the 60s and by his childhood. One of his videos was shown on MTV and when 'Bj?rk' (qv) saw it, she asked him to make her first solo video for 'Human Behaviour'. The partnership is famous: Gondry directed five other Bj?rk's videos, benefiting by the huge budgets. This led to commissions for other artists around the world, including Massive Attack. He also made a lot of commercials for Gap, Smirnoff, Air France, Nike, Coca Cola, Adidas, Polaroid and Levi - the latter making him the most highly-awarded director for a one-off commercial.  Hollywood became interested in Gondry's success and he directed his first feature movie _Human Nature (2001)_ (qv), adapting a 'Charlie Kaufman' (qv)'s scenario, which was shown in the 2001 Cannes Festival. Although it wasn't a big success, this film allowed him to direct _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)_ (qv), for which he again collaborated with Charlie Kaufman. The movie became a popular independent film and he and his co-writers won an Oscar for it. Michel Gondry 'The Village Voice' (USA), 19 February 2008, by: J.

Series Production Designer Video Movie featured in writer David Morrell    24 April 1943 David Morrell was born in 1943, shortly after his father was killed in action. His mother could not both raise him and have a job, so David was sent to an orphange. He went to Pennsylvania State University from 1966-70, where he was inspired by his teacher, writer William Tenn. In 1972 he wrote _First Blood (1982)_ (qv), which later became the legendary movie introducing John Rambo played by 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv) in 1982. He was a professor of American literature at the University of Iowa and taught from 1970 to 1986, where he resigned. In 1987 he lost his 15 year old son Matthew because of bone cancer. He left Iowa and today he lives with his wife and daughter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He has written several novels and First Blood is probably the most famous. David Morrell 'Knave' (UK), 1986, Vol. 18, Iss. 6, pg. 60-64, by: William Alland, 'The Man Who Made Rambo' David Morrell actually wrote _First Blood (1982)_ (qv) at the same time he was writing his dissertation on American literature, and submitted both at the same time. When his agent called to tell him of the sale, Morrell actually thought he was talking about his dissertation being accepted. The first scripts [for _Rambo III (1988)_ (qv)) I saw were excellent, particular the character of a fortyish female French physician who takes care of Afghan children injured during the war. The story had an epical RAMBO OF ARABIA feel. But for budgetary and other reasons, the scripts got simpler until the released film felt like a cartoon. One of the subtexts I added was that the Soviet War with Afghanistan was a version of America's involvement in Vietnam, with similar fracturing effects to each country's veterans and culture.

Episode Person Writer production designer actress Peter Jamison Lisa Haley   27 August 1944 Peter Jamison 15 October 2010 Venice, California, USA (complications from heart disease) Peter Michael Jamison Oregon, USA Lisa has worked with multi-Grammy winner/producer KebMo', Beatles' producer Sir George Martin, Little Richard, Peter Bogdonovitch, Jim Carey, Sam Kennison, Patrick Cranshaw, Robert Easton, Queen Ida, Brian Setzer, John Hiatt, Randy Newman, Lyle Lovett, Taj Mahal, Dave Koz, Rockin' Sydney, Joe Simien, and a host of others.  Lisa is featured as fiddle player Hortense Clampet in 'The Beverly Hillbillies Movie' as well as orchestral violinist in Jim Carey film 'The Man in the Moon' and Anthony Hopkins' 'Red Dragon'.  Born to an expatriate Southern family, she began performing at the age of four. Soon afterwards, the family moved to the Hollywood area, where her next-door neighbor, Mickey Mouse Show producer Bob Holoboff, offered to make her a Mousekateer. Her parents declined, preferring that she pursue a respectable career in classical music.  Her father's family songs, including the modal tunes of Louisiana, were banished to the garage. However, summer trips to Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Tennessee reinforced her Southern heritage. The resulting culture clash gravitated young Lisa to the lively, quirky music of her forefathers.  Entree to the Hollywood theater and music scene, a stint at age 17 as music director for an operetta company, and band experience with the engineer for the Beach Boys and Todd Rundgren, led her to turn down a classical music college scholarship, favoring the more passionate calling of her muse.  Snaring a spot with Grammy-winning Zydeco icon 'Queen Ida', Lisa toured the US, Canada and Europe to favorable reviews. The prot?g? of legendary Cajun accordionist Joe Simien, she also toured with Grammy-winners Al Rapone and Rockin' Sydney (writer of 'Don't Mess with My Toot-toot'.)  She is a descendant of Francis Scott Key, and kin to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Bill Haley, and the LeBoeuf, Broussard, Lambert and Thibodaux families.  Springboarding to her own group in 1995, Lisa performs with her All-Star band, The Zydekats, throughout the US, Canada and Europe, infecting the world with her special brand of Americana/Louisiana music known as 'Zydecosis'.  She played Gypsy violin on a Brian Setzer Orchestra album, and a mean fiddle on the soundtrack for the Adam Sandler movie 'The Waterboy'. She has also recorded for John Hiatt, John Barry, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Dramarama, and principal instrument for the movie 'The Grave'.  With eight albums to her credit, including GRAMMY Nominated 'King Cake,' the latest 'Joy Ride' and European release 'Louisiana', Lisa ignites the spirits of Americana, Zydeco/Cajun, Jazz, Rock, Christian, and Folk fans.  Her critically acclaimed song 'Always Be Your Guide' was used in feature film 'Mr. Atlas', and was a contender for the 'Lord of the Rings 3' soundtrack. Recent appearances include NBC's top-rated TV show 'Las Vegas', performing an original tune and playing with the legendary Little Richard.

Video Game Production Designer TV Movie Actress actor actress Kelly McGillis David Leitch    'Parade Magazine' (USA), November 1997, pg. 22, by: James Brady, 'In Step With: Kelly McGillis' 'Boyd Black' (14 April 1979 - 1981) (divorced) Wanted to play the role of 'Kathryn Murphy', the district attorney in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv), because she and her roommate were assaulted and raped by two men in their apartment in 1982. 'Celebrity Sleuth' (USA), 1991, Vol. 5, Iss. 1, pg. 58-59, by: staff, 'Not To Be Myth'd: Kelly McGillis' For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured. It wasn't until I started seeing myself self-destructing that I realized I needed help. To realize how angry I was and to ask for help -- those were the stepping stones. There's a part of me that wants to be stoic and very strong. I had to realize that the attack wasn't directed at me, as Kelly. It was random. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was the first step toward getting rid of all those hostile feelings I had about it. Still, when you're a victim of a violent crime -- when somebody has taken control over your life, if only for a moment -- I don't think you ever fully recover. - Speaking about her reactions to being raped. Appeared in production of John Webber's play 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Shakespeare Theatre, Washington, DC. (2002) McGillis, Kelly Ann 9 July 1957 (March 2004) Performing on stage as 'Mrs. Robinson' in the national touring company of the play 'The Graduate.' Kelly McGillis was born in Newport Beach, California, to Joan, a homemaker, and Donald McGillis, a general practitioner of medicine. She decided to drop out of high school to pursue a career as an actress and eventually attended Juilliard in Manhattan and Pacific Conservatory of Performing Art in Santa Monica, CA.  She held a variety of jobs while pursuing her career, such as waitressing, and snagged a few stage roles before landing a supporting part in the Academy Award-nominated _Reuben, Reuben (1983)_ (qv). This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) in the highly acclaimed thriller _Witness (1985)_ (qv). This box office hit, directed by 'Peter Weir (I)' (qv), got her noticed around Hollywood and producers took note of her. One of them was 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit _Top Gun (1986)_ (qv) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.  Ironically, that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in _The Accused (1988)_ (qv) with 'Jodie Foster' (qv) who won an Academy Award for her role, but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold, she remained loyal to the theater, even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s, taking such various stage roles in such 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) plays as 'The Merchant of Venice', 'Don Juan', 'Twelfth Night', 'The Merry Wives of Windsor', 'Mourning Becomes Electra' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1994 she scored the title role in the Broadway production of 'Hedda Gabler' but unfortunately it only played for 33 performances before closing.  She had two daughters in the early 1990s, and worked more sporadically on TV and film so she could spend time with her family and owned her business, a restaurant in Florida. She worked on _Winter People (1989)_ (qv), _Cat Chaser (1989)_ (qv), _The Babe (1992)_ (qv), _North (1994)_ (qv), _At First Sight (1999)_ (qv) and _The Monkey's Mask (2000)_ (qv) as well as a string of made-for-TV films.  She has completed a national stage tour of 'The Graduate', playing the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and continues to act as she begins study on Addiction Studies and raising her children in Pennsylvania.

She made a choice to take a three-year hiatus from acting as a result just as her career had reached its peak. Her film career never fully recovered after she came back. She originally was offered the top Bondian love interest that 'Barbara Bach (I)' (qv) portrayed in _The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)_ (qv) by director 'Lewis Gilbert (II)' (qv) but turned it because of her initial self-imposed hiatus.

Later, she choreographed the hit film _American Graffiti (1973)_ (qv) and also began appearing in films, including the now-classic _Easy Rider (1969)_ (qv). After several films, she launched her music career with her first album, 'Word of Mouth', in 1981, which was released both as a record and a video, quite an innovation at the time. Culled from that album was a innocent little ditty called 'Mickey', which soon became a massive hit all over the world, first in Britain. The song topped the American music charts in December 1982, and the video (directed by Basil, as were all of her others) still receives airplay, today. In 1984, Toni Basil's self-titled follow-up album was released, which included the American Top 40 hit 'Over My Head'. Although she found future chart success elusive, Basil remained busy appearing in such films as _Rockula (1990)_ (qv) and has appeared in a guest shot on _'Baywatch' (1989)_ (qv) in the late 1990s. Her choreographer talents have also been utilized lately by superstars 'Bette Midler' (qv) and 'David Bowie' (qv) and, in 1998, she choreographed a successful ad for 'The Gap'.

The new CD and children's book are expected to be released in 2007. Connie Berman (foreword by Dolly Parton). _The Official Dolly Parton Scrapbook._ New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1978. ISBN 0- 44816176-1 Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, one of 12 children of Robert Lee Parton, a tobacco farmer, and Avie Lee Parton (n?e Owens). Dolly grew up on a run-down farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12, she was appearing on Knoxville TV and, at 13, she was already recording on a small label and appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. After graduating from high school in Sevier County, Tennessee, in 1964, she moved to Nashville to launch her career as a country singer. She fell in love with 'Carl Dean' (qv), who ran an asphalt-paving business; they got married on May 30, 1966 (and they are still together). The next year, Dolly's singing caught the attention of 'Porter Wagoner' (qv). He hired Dolly to appear on his program, _'The Porter Wagoner Show' (1961)_ (qv). Dolly stayed with the show for 7 years, their duets became famous, and she appeared with his group at the Grand Ole Opry; she also toured and sold records. By the time her hit 'Joshua' reached #1 in 1970, her fame had overshadowed Porter's, and she struck out on her own, though still recording duets with him. She left him for good to become a solo artist in 1974. Dolly gained immense popularity as a singer/songwriter. Dolly won numerous Country Music Association awards (1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1976). This petite (5'0') beauty was a natural for television and, by the mid-1970s, Dolly was appearing frequently on TV specials and talk shows. Dolly then got her own show, aptly titled _'Dolly' (1976)_ (qv). In 1977, Dolly got her first Grammy award: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, for her song 'Here You Come Again'. Dolly's movie debut was in _Nine to Five (1980)_ (qv), where she got an Oscar nomination for writing the title tune, and also Grammy awards 2 and 3, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the song 'Nine to Five'. Dolly got more fame for appearing in _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)_ (qv), and in _Rhinestone (1984)_ (qv) with the song 'Tennessee Homesick Blues'. She is the head of Dolly Parton Enterprises, a $100 million media empire, and, in 1986, she founded Dollywood, a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrating her Smokey Mountain upbringing. She appeared as herself in the _'Dolly' (1987)_ (qv) TV series. In 1988, she won another Grammy award: Best Country Performance Duo or Group with Vocals, for 'Trio'. Dolly was in the acclaimed picture _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv) with 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv), and went on to appear in 15 movies and TV-movies for the 1990s, and of course garnered more Country Music Association awards. In 2000, Dolly received her 5th Grammy award: Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. She also released a Bluegrass Album. Dolly is known for beautiful songs such as 'Coat of Many Colors' and 'Jolene' and 'I Will Always Love You'. Dolly said in an interview, 'My music is what took me everywhere I've been and everywhere I will go. It's my greatest love. I can't abandon it. I'll always keep making records'.

At the age of 11, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. His first band was called Bluesology. He later auditioned (unsuccessfully) as lead singer for the progressive rock bands 'King Crimson' (qv) and Gentle Giant. Dwight teamed up with lyricist 'Bernie Taupin' (qv) and changed his name to Elton John (merging the names of saxophonist 'Elton Dean' (qv) and 'Long John Baldry' (qv)). The duo wrote songs for 'Lulu (I)' (qv) and 'Roger Cook (II)' (qv). In the early 1970s, he recorded the concept album 'Tumbleweed Connection.' He became the most successful pop artist of the 1970s, and he has survived many different pop fads including punk, the New Romantics and Britpop to remain one of Britain's most internationally acclaimed musicians.  Elton John announced he was a bisexual in 1976, and in 1984, he married Renate Blauel. The marriage lasted four years before he finally came to terms with the fact that he was actually homosexual. In the 1970s and 1980s, he suffered from drug and alcohol addiction and bulimia but came through it. He is well known as a campaigner for AIDS research and he keeps his finger on the pulse of modern music, enjoying artists such as 'Eminem' (qv), 'Radiohead' (qv), 'Coldplay' (qv) and 'Robbie Williams (I)' (qv).

Series Production Designer TV Movie actor edited into  Will Forte   17 June 1970 'Playboy' (USA), April 2010, Vol. 57, Iss. 3, pg. 76-77+105-106, by: Eric Spitznagel, '20Q: Will Forte' (October 2003) Currently in his second season on SNL; his first as a Repertory Player. Forte was age 32 before he came to the public's attention on Saturday Night Live, but had been working in comedy since 1997. Forte is the son of artist Patricia and financial broker Orville Willis Forte III (divorced) and has one older sister, Michelle. A creative and artist child, in high school he was an athlete (football and swimming) in high school and voted Best Personality at Acalanes High School. After graduating from UCLA with a degree in History, Forte had a brief career at a brokerage house before deciding to try comedy. Although he rarely performed stand-up, he joined the world famous Groundlings and was hired as a writer for the series The Jenny McCarthy Show, The Army Show, and The David Letterman Show. He eventually caught the attention of Carsey-Werner executive Tom Werner when he wrote a pilot about two childlike idiot brothers (eventually turned into the film The Brothers Solomon) and was hired for the shows Third Rock From the Sun and That 70s Show.  In 2002, Forte moved from his home state of California to New York City to join Saturday Night Live as a writer and cast member. Although known as shy and reserved in his personal life, Forte was one of the individuals responsible for the shows move to absurd, surrealist comedy. Along with voice over acting, guest appearances on television and small roles in films, Forte had his biggest opportunities to be a movie star with films he wrote. Forte wrote the screenplay for The Brother's Solomon (and had the leading role of childlike Dean Solomon) and played the title role and co-wrote the SNL film MacGruber. Although both films were given small budgets ($10,000,000 each), the were both considered box-office and critical failures, although they do have a cult following.  After MacGruber's theatrical release, Forte left SNL for personal and professional reasons, although he has returned as a guest performer. Forte has had a recurring role on the series 30 Rock and made numerous other guest appearances on other TV comedies. Since leaving SNL, he has also increased his work as a voice artist and appeared in 5 movies (A Good Old Fashioned Orgy, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie, Rock of Ages, That's My Boy, and The Watch).  Since 2012, he has moved into dramatic and straight roles on a television pilot titled Rebounding by the producers of Modern Family and Irish film Run and Jump. In August 2012, he was cast (and first choice) in the much anticipated Alexander Payne film Nebraska, despite rumors that higher profile actors such as Casey Affleck and Paul Rudd were interested in the role.

[on if he feels he understands what audiences want] No. I've tried to get better about weighing what I think the accessibility of an idea is against the cost of executing it. I've tried to be smarter about that, because if you're not smart about that, you're going to be unemployed. But I'm still mystified about what works for people. And I'm not talking about my movies, I'm talking in general. I'm mystified by the stuff that doesn't work. I'm mystified by what's going on in the critical side, too. Stuff I like is getting trashed and stuff that is being praised I think is terrible. I don't really feel in sync with what's happening, but at the same time, what I think keeps me afloat is that I try not to be, and don't want to be, very indulgent. I try to make the films as lean as possible, and to not spend a lot of time crawling up my own ass creatively. Directed stage play, 'Geniuses', for Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge, LA. (1996) Soderbergh, Steven A. 14 January 1963 Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, 'Peter Soderbergh' (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film 'Janitor'. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group 'Yes' (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress 'Betsy Brantley' (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray's Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars. Steven Soderbergh 'The New York Times' (USA), 23 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,319, pg. E1 & E8, by: A.O.

Born on April 11, 1944 in St. Louis, Missouri, Milius was one of the first movie industry professionals to be a film school graduate, having matriculated at the University of Southern California. In 1967, Milius won first prize at USC School of Cinema-for his student film _Marcello, I'm Bored (1970)_ (qv).

He started taking piano lessons when he was 7 years old. Eventually, he went on to become a student at USC, where he studied the arts of directing, cinematography, editing, sound and, of course, music. It was also at USC he met 'John Milius' (qv) and 'Randal Kleiser' (qv), both acclaimed directors with whom he would work in the future. Even though Basil had already composed music to 'John Milius' (qv)' much talked about _Big Wednesday (1978)_ (qv), his real breakthrough came in 1982 when he composed the score to Milius' epic fantasy movie, _Conan the Barbarian (1982)_ (qv). The powerful themes that Basil created for this movie opened the eyes of the movie industry, as well as the public, and it is arguably one of the best soundtracks of the 80s. Basil went on to make soundtracks for such movies as: _RoboCop (1987)_ (qv) (the second 'Paul Verhoeven (I)' (qv) movie of many for which he has composed, the first being 1985's _Flesh+Blood (1985)_ (qv)), _'Lonesome Dove' (1989)_ (qv) (for which he won an Emmy), _Farewell to the King (1989)_ (qv), _The Hunt for Red October (1990)_ (qv), _Free Willy (1993)_ (qv), in 'Paul Verhoeven (I)' (qv)'s _Starship Troopers (1997)_ (qv) with 'Casper Van Dien' (qv) and 'Denise Richards' (qv) and _Les Mis?rables (1998)_ (qv).

Video Game Editor Person director composer Tim Truman Stephen Milburn Anderson   Tim Truman  The musical life of Tim Truman started with the world of percussion. He immersed himself in rhythm winning awards all through his early school years topping it off with the 'Best Musician in California' at the Hollywood Bowl. His college studies began to change as it was not enough for the exploratory musician. He shifted his focus to original musical composition. He was accepted into the coveted USC composition department. From there he began scoring prime-time network television. George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola selected Tim Truman to complete the score to the 70 mm 3D Disneyland feature 'Captain EO' Starring Michael Jackson. Michael Mann hand picked Tim to replace Jan Hammer on his hit show 'Miami Vice' scoring the entire fifth season. The Michael Mann directed movie 'LA Takedown' was next gathering strong reviews. Tim then composed the original Main Title theme to 'Melrose Place' going on to score over 120+ episodes of that world wide hit. Oliver Stone asked Tim to score the controversial film 'South Central' with a full orchestra for Warner Brothers. The television and features continued with an EMMY nomination for the Main Title Theme to 'Central Park West'. The entire debut season of 'Charmed' was in Tim's hands as well. Tim has been honored with several ASCAP, Gold and Platinum album and video awards. Tim Truman won an EMMY as a co-producer on 'The Killer Whale People' with Nancy Wilson (Heart). He then Executive produced 'One World' with Olivia Newton John garnering five EMMY nominations. SHOWTIME brought in Tim to score all 35 hour episodes of 'Jeremiah' created by J.

With thousands of productions guiding his focus, an unwavering eye for truth, Tim Truman continues to expand the possibilities of tomorrow. Tim Truman Stephen Milburn Anderson Stephen M.

She is the daughter of a mechanical engineer in an extended family of cousins, aunts and uncles who are engineers. Her upbringing was conservative: Southern and traditional Chinese. She was also a tomboy and spent her childhood hiking and camping in the Smoky Mountains.  Evelyn excelled in academics. In junior high, she was voted 'Most Likely to Succeed.' In her high school years, she attended Governor's School for International Studies and was a delegate to the North American Model United Nations in Washington D.C. She was also the 'Teen Times' columnist in the city newspaper The Oak Ridger. Evelyn took only advanced classes in high school. She scored the highest possible score on every national AP exam, which gave her enough credits to place out of math and science entirely at UCLA before beginning her freshman year.  Instead of joining her family tradition of engineering, she decided to pursue liberal arts and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English. Ironically, after getting her B.A, she went to work for NBC as a broadcast engineer, handling jobs from chyron C.G. to programming a 16-screen video wall. She made her mark during the O.J. Simpson trial, where she worked 80-100 hour weeks for the duration of both trials.  After the verdicts, she took a couple of weeks off and traveled around the nation. She fell in love with New York City, promptly quit her job and moved to Manhattan. Soon after her move, a photographer asked to shoot photos of her. Those pictures caused a career change from working behind the camera to working in front of the camera. She was picked up by NYC modeling agents and began working as a fitness model. Evelyn is known for her six-pack abs definition.  She also explored other career paths. She worked in the financial sector for automotive legend Malcolm Bricklin in his quest to bring Chinese cars into the U.S. She worked in the real estate field where she held a NY real estate salesperson license and NY state notary public license. She worked in IT technical support troubleshooting and fixing software issues directly and through remote interface.  Evelyn continued to model, which led to an interest in acting. She immediately got her SAG & AFTRA cards, which totaled her career union memberships to 5: National Association of Broadcast Employees & Technicians (NABET-CWA), Director's Guild of America (DGA), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), Screen Actor's Guild & American Federation of Television & Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA).  Evelyn moved back to Los Angeles in 2010, but always kept her Union Square apartment. Her first year back, she missed NYC so much she returned 11 times. At this point, she made a decision to become bi-coastal and travels back and forth to whichever coast work takes her. Evelyn Liu Undergraduate B.A. from UCLA. Got into Columbia Business School Program, went one term, then dropped out to live and surf in Costa Rica. Defined abs Ev Female

Rolling Stone Magazine recognizes him as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time and highlights from recent composing and playing can be heard in the upcoming Will Ferrell comedy 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' for Sony Pictures. His signature song 'Edge of the Switchblade' runs at the end title credits for the film.  On television, Wayne's 2003 title theme for Fox Sports Network's extreme sports program 5-4-3-2-1 was a bona fide hit and he now has three others running there - Spotlight, In My Own Words and Under the Lights.

After leaving Elektra, they released two albums on Atlantic Records, Back In The USA, produced by Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau, and the critically hailed High Time. Between world tours, Wayne wrote scores for the Caroline Films feature Gold and The Living Theatre's film production of Paradise Now.  Wayne spent the'80s in New York City, where he teamed up with the infamous Johnny Thunders for a short-lived, but headline grabbing, punk rock supergroup Gang War.

Video Game Series Character Actor null writer Ian Fleming     'Anne Geraldine Charteris' (24 March 1952 - 12 August 1964) (his death); 1 child Canterbury, Kent, England, UK (heart attack) His wife, Anne Geraldine Charteris, was the granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Wemyss, and had been previously married to Shane O'Neill, 3rd Lord O'Neill (she was his widow) and then to Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, whom she divorced to marry Ian. Anne and Ian had one son, Casper Robert Fleming, born 12th of August 1952. I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.

Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a 'show trial' in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called 'Goldeneye,' took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called 'Casino Royale.' Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56. Ian Fleming 'The New York Times' (USA), 19 May 2008, Vol. 157, Iss. 54,315, pg. E1 & E6, by: John F.

The gun sling that the prop guy made for the movie used a quick-release parachute capo. That was pretty cool. It was great to have that group back again, because at that point, we all appreciated what it was. It was probably the most fun job I've ever worked on. It was so sweet. Such redemption. I'm sorry the movie didn't make more money at the theaters. If we'd had three more million viewers for the show, we'd still be on the air, and if we'd had three million more butts in the seats, we'd probably have made a sequel or two. ... I think the movie title was also kind of misleading. I mean, Serenity is the right title, but also the wrong title. It sounds like a yoga class to the uninitiated. Also, the movie is much darker than the series. There wasn't as much camp and fun. That may have hurt it too. (A.V.

Episode Movie Producer actor spoofed in  Joe Spinell   'Psychotronic Video' (USA), 1989, Iss. 2, by: Tom Rainone, 'Joe Spinell - His Last Interview' 'Jean Jennings (I)' (qv) (February 1977 - July 1979) (divorced); 1 child New York City, New York, USA (heart attack) Attended the Madison Square Boys Club located on 29th Street in New York when he was nine. I don't even think of _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) as a horror movie. The horrible thing is that people like this really exist. Radio interview for the film _Maniac (1980)_ (qv) with 'William Lustig' (qv) & 'Caroline Munro' (qv). _The Joe Spinell Story (2001) (V)_ (qv) Spagnuolo, Joseph J. 28 October 1936 Joseph J. Spagnuolo was born on October 28, 1936 in Manhattan, New York City at his family's apartment on 2nd Avenue. Spinell was a tough guy on and off screen all his life. During his teen years, while still in high school, he acted in various plays on the New York stage, on and off Broadway, eventually earning a place in Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival Theater. In 1960, he parlayed his stage work into a performing contract for MGM where it was suggested that he change his name to Joe Spinell to make his name easier to pronounce. For nine years, Spinell worked with the group, which was also known as the Theater of the Forgotten, which also put on plays in prisons for the inmates. His minimal salary for his stage work forced him to hold down other jobs to make ends meet. Those jobs included working as a taxi driver, a post office clerk, and a liquor store clerk during Christmas holidays.  In 1972, Spinell was first noticed when he appeared in his first movie role which was a small, uncredited speaking part in The Godfather (1972), the right film for a tough, mean-looking Italian with a New York City accent. After his success, he became a familiar character actor that appeared in violent urban movies where he was usually cast as vicious thugs or seedy gang leaders. In both Godfather movies he was the hit man Willy Cici. In Rocky (1976), the first of several films he made with Sylvester Stallone, he was the loan shark Gazzo who employs Rocky as a collector.  His best (or worst) or most disgusting role is probably the one where is his best remembered; in a rare starring role, his character of Frank Zito in Maniac (1980) is a serial killer that kills women and uses their scalps to dress up female mannequins he keeps in his apartment. After Maniac (1980), Spinell continued acting with big-name Hollywood and independent movie directors usually playing villainous thugs in small to medium roles.  During the last years of his life Spinell's choice of projects becomes increasingly suspect; for example imprisoned serial killer John Wayne Gacy wanted Spinell to play him in a movie. But with Maniac (1980) still on his mind, Spinell always wanted to do a sequel to the movie and with New York filmmaker Buddy Giovinazzo, they shot a 10-minute promo reel in 1986 titled Mr. Robbie, which was to be the sequel for Maniac (1980). After a few years of hard work and searching, Spinell found financing for the sequel. But just as pre-production was to begin, Joe Spinell suddenly passed away in his apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, New York on January 13, 1989, at age 52 due to undetermined causes, still the subject of much speculation. Some say he died of a heart attack because of his failing health in recent months due to his heavy drinking, drug use, and the emotional turmoil resulting from his mother's death (who passed away in 1987.) Others say he died from an asthma attack, or that he bled to death from an accidental (or deliberate) cut since he was a hemophiliac.  Spinnel left behind an impressive body of film work that stands as a testament to his talent and unique screen presence as a character actor. He is survived by an ex-wife, a daughter, two brothers and a sister.
